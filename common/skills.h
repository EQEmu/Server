/*
	NOTE: Disregard this until it is sorted out

	I changed (tradeskill==75) to ExtSkillGenericTradeskill in tradeskills.cpp for both instances. 	If it's a pseudo-enumeration of
	an AA ability, then use the 'ExtSkill' ('ExtendedSkill') prefix with a value >= 100. (current implementation)

	We probably need to recode ALL of the skill checks to use the new Skill2HPiercing and ensure that the animation value is
	properly changed in the patch files. As far as earlier clients using this new skill, it can be done, but we just need to ensure
	that skill address is not inadvertently passed to the client..and we can just send an actual message for the skill-up. Use of a
	command can tell the player what that particular skill value is.

	Nothing on SkillTripleAttack just yet..haven't looked into its current implementation.

	In addition to the above re-coding, we're probably going to need to rework the database pp blob to reserve space for the current
	100-dword buffer allocation. This way, we can just add new ones without having to rework it each time.
	(Wasn't done for this in particular..but, thanks Akkadius!)

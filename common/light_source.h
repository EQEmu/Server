			- If values > 0x0F are valid, then assignment limiters will need to be removed
			- MainCursor 'appears' to be a valid light source update slot..but, have not experienced updates during debug sessions
			- All clients have a bug regarding stackable items (light and sound updates are not processed when picking up an item)

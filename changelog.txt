EQEMu Changelog (Started on Sept 24, 2003 15:50)
-------------------------------------------------------

== 9/17/2017 ==
Akkadius: Add model/race offset to FixZ calc (KLS)
Akkadius: Fix 95% of food/water consumption issues, if there are additional modifiers for race/class combos - those will need to be applied

Stages should be put in place if not already:
https://wiki.project1999.com/Food_and_drink#Stages_of_Hunger_and_Thirst

Values stored in the database are 0-6000, previously we capped it at 6000 but previous math would have normal values in the 60k+ range in order for food to be consumed at a reasonable rate. We are now using more native logic where 1 = 1 minute, following logic:

(Minutes)
0 -  5	- This is a snack.
6 -  20	- This is a meal.
21 - 30	- This is a hearty meal.
31 - 40	- This is a banquet size meal.
41 - 50	- This meal is a feast!
51 - 60	- This is an enduring meal!
61 - X	- This is a miraculous meal!

== 7/14/2017 ==
Akkadius: HP Update tuning - HP Updates are now forced when a client is targeted
Akkadius: Client position updates should be smoother (granted the client has a good connection)
	- Clients should also no longer randomly disappear 

== 7/11/2017 ==
Akkadius: Raid/Group/XTarget HP/Mana/Endurance updates now only send when percentage changes
Akkadius: Raid/Group Mana/Endurance updates should now update real-time once again
Akkadius: Fixed an issue with clients looking like they are 'skipping' when they are moving in view of another client
Akkadius: Fixed an issue with NPC's who are ghosted in plain view of a client when they are not really there

== 7/9/2017 ==
Akkadius: Fix HP update issues, rework logic for more accurate HP updates
Akkadius: Massive reductions in unnecessary network traffic especially during high spam combat fights
	- HP Updates now only send to others when HP percentage changes (0-100%)
		- HP Updates were sending excessively even during idle zones when HP wasn't changing at all
	- Attack animations now only send once per second versus up to a hundred times a second per Mob/Client
	- 17,000 OP_ClientUpdate packets per second have been observed in combat scenarios, some of the major culprits have been
		throttled without affecting what the client should see
	- Before and After packet differences under similar load/tests (Packets per second)
		- 7,000 - 8,000 	OP_Animation pps	After: 600-800 pps
		- 13,0000 - 17,000 	OP_MobHealth pps	After: 1-10 pps
		- 15,0000 - 20,000 	OP_ClientUpdate pps	After: 500-1,000 pps
	- Packet reports from a 46 client test here:
		https://gist.github.com/Akkadius/28b7ad2fdd82bdd15ea737c68f404346
	- Servers who use Marquee HP updates will also recieve far less packet spam as they will only be sent when HP changes

== 7/1/2017 ==
Akkadius: Resolve issues with NPC's hopping to the ceiling in small corridors
Akkadius: Improved grounding issues with NPC's during combat
Akkadius: Improved scenarios where NPC's need to be dragged out of the ground - they should correct themselves far more consistently
	- Scenarios where an NPC is coming up from the bottom floor, or from the top floor, they will correct much better
	- A video of these tests can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtC7bVNM7ZQ&feature=youtu.be

== 6/28/2017 ==
Akkadius: Fixed issues with Z correctness when NPCs are pathing on normal grids
Akkadius: Fixed issues with Z correctness when NPCs are engaged with players following
Akkadius: NPC corpses should fall into the ground far less

== 6/25/2017 ==
Akkadius: New rules made by developers are now automatically created when world boots up, this keeps 
	from having to issue schema SQL updates every time rules are added.
	- Whenever a rule isn't present in the database, it will be automatically created
Akkadius: Sped up saylink retrieval x1000 helpful for dialogues, plugins with many saylinks

== 4/16/2017 ==
KLS: Merge eqstream branch
	- UDP client stack completely rewritten should both have better throughput and recover better (peq has had far fewer reports of desyncs).
	- TCP Server to Server connection stack completely rewritten.
		- Server connections reconnect much more reliably and quickly now.
		- Now supports optional packet encryption via libsodium (https://download.libsodium.org/doc/).
		- Protocol behind the tcp connections has changed (see breaking changes section).
		- API significantly changed and should be easier to write new servers or handlers for.
		- Telnet console connection has been separated out from the current port (see breaking changes section).
			- Because of changes to the TCP stack, lsreconnect and echo have been disabled.
	- The server tic rate has been changed to be approx 30 fps from 500+ fps.
		- Changed how missiles and movement were calculated slightly to account for this (Missiles in particular are not perfect but close enough).
	
	- Breaking changes:
		- Users who use the cmake install feature should be aware that the install directory is now %cmake_install_dir%/bin instead of just %cmake_install_dir%/
		- To support new features such as encryption the underlying protocol had to change... however some servers such as the public login server will be slow to change so we've included a compatibility layer for legacy login connections:
			- You should add <legacy>1</legacy> to the login section of your configuration file when connecting to a server that is using the old protocol.  
			- The central eqemu login server uses the old protocol and probably will for the forseeable future so if your server is connecting to it be sure to add that tag to your configuration file in that section.
			- Telnet no longer uses the same port as the Server to Server connection and because of this the tcp tag no longer has any effect on telnet connections.
				- To enable telnet you need to add a telnet tag in the world section of configuration such as:
					<telnet ip="0.0.0.0" port="9001" enabled="true"/>

== 4/1/2017 ==
Akkadius: Cleaned up some of the NPC to NPC aggro code, only do aggro checks to other NPC's when the NPC is flagged for it
Akkadius: [Performance] Reworked how all log calls are made in the source
	- Before we used Log.Out, we will now use a macro Log(
		- Before: Log.Out(Logs::General, Logs::Status, "Importing Spells...");
		- After: Log(Logs::General, Logs::Status, "Importing Spells...");
	- The difference is 
		1) It's 200-300x faster especially when log statements are inside very hot code paths. We already
			had most hot paths checked before we logged them, but this blankets all existing logging calls now and not just the 
			select few we had picked out in the source.
		2) Strings don't get copied to the stack, popped and pushed constantly even when we hit a log statement that 
			actually isn't going to log anything.
				- We do an 'if (LogSys.log_settings[log_category].is_category_enabled == 1)' before we call a log function
					in the log macro so the log function doesn't get called at all if we're not logging the category
	- This has increased binary executables roughly 15KB
	- The old extern for EQEmuLogSys is now named LogSys appropriately instead of Log (Ex: LogSys.StartFileLogs())
	- The result keeps logging footprint non-existent for when we're not logging that category

== 03/30/2017 ==
Akkadius: [Performance] Fixed an overhead issue where many hot paths would trigger quest subroutines and beneath that the code would
	try to see if a quest existed perpetually (checking if file exists) even though it should have determined the quest 
	didn't exist the first time.
	- This caused a lot of overhead in an instance where an entire zone of NPC's is pathing, triggering EVENT_WAYPOINT_ARRIVE
	and EVENT_WAYPOINT_DEPART when there is no global_npc.pl/lua, or all NPC's pathing don't have a quest assigned, similar 
	behavior would occur. This goes for any other type of quests: spells, items, encounters etc.

== 03/28/2017 ==
Akkadius: [Performance] Fixed a large overhead issue where every single NPC in a zone was checking to depop themselves
	as a swarm pet every 3ms regardless of being a swarm pet or not. Swarm pets now check to depop only when their timer is up
Akkadius: [Performance] Removed a timer where clients would constantly calculate light amount on equipment every 600ms, instead 
	clients will update light when changing equipment or entering a zone
Akkadius: [Performance] Disabled enraged timer checks for NPC's that do not actually have enrage as a special attack
Akkadius: [Performance] Don't process ProjectileAttack checks for NPC's that are not engaged in any combat

== 03/27/2017 ==
Akkadius: [Performance] Reworked how client to NPC aggro checks are made
	- Before when reverse aggro checks were done (client to NPC), checks would happen every 750 millseconds where a client would
		check an entire entity list with distance calcs and other checks for aggro, with many clients in a zone and many NPC's this would
		add a lot of unecessary overhead. A temporary adjustment on 3/25 was made and upped the check to 6 seconds.
	- Now, there is a new methodology to scanning. The client will build a cache list of NPC's within close range as defined in new rule:
		RULE_INT(Range, ClientNPCScan, 300) and will also get any NPC that has an aggro range beyond that defined range to use in 
		the frequent checks for aggro, the result is far less overhead
	- Client scanning changes when moving versus not moving, the client will scan aggro every 500 milliseconds while moving, and
		3000 millseconds aggro check when not moving, with a 6000ms re-fetch for close NPC's
	- A demo of these changes can be found here:
		https://youtu.be/aGroiwLSTVU

== 03/25/2017 ==
Akkadius: [Performance] Reduced CPU footprint in non-combat zones doing constant checks for combat related activities
Akkadius: [Performance] Reduced CPU footprint in cases where a client is checking for aggro excessively every 750 millseconds. This has 
	been adjusted to 6 seconds per new rule RULE_INT(Aggro, ClientAggroCheckInterval)
	- When zones have many players, with many NPC's, this adds up quickly

== 03/12/2017 ==
Akkadius: [Performance]
- Implemented range rules for packets and other functions
	RULE_INT ( Range, Say, 135 )
	RULE_INT ( Range, Emote, 135 )
	RULE_INT ( Range, BeginCast, 200)
	RULE_INT ( Range, Anims, 135)
	RULE_INT ( Range, SpellParticles, 135)
	RULE_INT ( Range, DamageMessages, 50)
	RULE_INT ( Range, SpellMessages, 75)
	RULE_INT ( Range, SongMessages, 75)
	RULE_INT ( Range, MobPositionUpdates, 600)
	RULE_INT ( Range, CriticalDamage, 80)
	
 - (Readability) Also cleaned up some formatting in messaging and packets so it is easier to understand what is going on with the code

== 03/09/2017 ==
Uleat: Fixed a few glitches related to bot trading and other affected code
	- Added a temporary fail clause for partial stack transfers to prevent client item overwrites
	- Return messages no longer repeat the top cursor item when multiple items are pushed there
	- Test slot for client returns is now handled appropriately for parent and bag searches
	- FindFreeSlotForTradeItem() now begins at the correct bag index on subsequent parent iterations
Uleat: First step of implementing inventory v2.0

== 03/08/2017 ==
Uleat: Complete rework of the bot trading system
	- Equipment slot priority can now be tailored..though, a recompile will be required
	- All item validations and slot assignments for trades and returns are now performed before any actual item movements occur
	- Failed trade/returned items will now go straight into the client's inventory, just like a normal trade transaction
		- A 'green' message appears at the end of each successful trade informing the trader of 'accepted' and 'returned' item counts
		- Bots respond to the trader directly now instead of using BotGroupSay()
	- Bots will still only allow trades from their owner (currently, too high a risk of exploit and/or malicious activity)
	- Partial stack movements (i.e., ammo refills) have been scoped..but, not implemented
	- I have not been able to reproduce any 'illegal' weapon combinations with this code
	- NOTE: The report of item duplication with bot return items appears to be an inventory desync condition
		- I experienced this condition both before and after the rework with RoF+ clients (UF- appears ok)
		- The bug lies within the actual client inventory system and not with bot trades
	- Please post any issues with this change as they arise

== 02/27/2017 ==
Uleat: Notes on bot movement speed changes:
	- Clients (players) appear to be on a different speed scale than other entities (NPCs, etc...)
	- The server does not calculate deltas/velocities for moving players..those come the client itself
	- GetBotWalkspeed() and GetBotRunspeed() are specific to bot movement calculations
	- The class Mob equivilents are not scalared so that a 'client-oriented' value can still be attained
	- The value of ~1.786f is derived from the ratio of 1.25f/0.7f (npc speed/client speed)
	- Modifying the two speeds like this is a rough guess-timate..but, appears to at least bring the incongruous behavior to acceptable levels

== 02/26/2017 ==
Uleat: Moved bot `npc_spells` entries from '701-712' to 3000 + <class_id> .. also, added melee types for future expansion
Uleat: Moved bot spell casting chance values into database - this will allow admins to tailor their bots without having to rebuild server code
	- Each entry uses a 3-dimensional identifier: [spell type index][class id][stance index]
		- [spell type index] is not the SpellType_## bit value..use SpellType_##Index instead
		- [class id] values of 1-16 are valid and hold a direct correlation to server-coded player class values
		- [stance index] is a direct correlation (0-6)
		- the 'conditional fields' are currently predicated on 4 compounded boolean states:
			- `pH_value` represents bit '0'
			- `pS_value` represents bit '1'
			- `pN_value` represents bit '2'
			- `pD_value` represents bit '3'
			- all other conditional fields are masked based on these 4 predicates
		- the full conditional field enumeration is as follows:
			- `nHSND_value`		- negative Healer/Slower/Nuker/Doter
			- `pH_value`		- positive Healer
			- `pS_value`		- positive Slower
			- `pHS_value`		- positive Healer/Slower
			- `pN_value`		- positive Nuker
			- `pHN_value`		- positive Healer/Nuker
			- `pSN_value`		- positive Slower/Nuker
			- `pHSN_value`		- positive Healer/Slower/Nuker
			- `pD_value`		- positive Doter
			- `pHD_value`		- positive Healer/Doter
			- `pSD_value`		- positive Slower/Doter
			- `pHSD_value`		- positive Healer/Slower/Doter
			- `pND_value`		- positive Nuker/Doter
			- `pHND_value`		- positive Healer/Nuker/Doter
			- `pSND_value`		- positive Slower/Nuker/Doter
			- `pHSND_value`		- positive Healer/Slower/Nuker/Doter
	- Single- and mixed-bits fields should be filled-in based on the boolean 'AND' concept
		- (i.e., if 'healer' then `pH_value`=x; if 'slower' then `pS_value`=y; if 'healer' AND 'slower' then `pHS_value`=z; )
		- most cases can allow the same value across all fields..but, there are some that shouldn't and this format allows for their discrimination
	- Valid `##_value` entries are 0-100..though, the field accepts up to 255... Anything above 100 is clamped to 100 upon loading, however...
	- Not all conditions are currently coded and changing a field may not produce any results
	- The 'default' database values will be changed and tweaked as bot spell code modifications occur

== 02/25/2017 ==
Uleat: Implemented rule-based node pathing for bots
	- This currently applies to out-of-combat following movement and blocked los in-combat movement
	- The default is set to 'true' (use node pathing)..so, consider disabling it if cpu use is too high
	- If you want to disable node pathing, apply the optional sql '2017_02_25_bots_use_pathing_rule.sql' file located in the utils/sql/git/bots/optional sub-directory. This will apply a 'false' rule..but, it can be changed as desired
	- This helps with bot movement..but, there are still issues...
Uleat: Implemented rule-based position update packet with movement timer check for bots
	- This currently only applies to out-of-combat movement
	- The default is set to 'false' (original behavior) to help save bandwidth (each bot will send an update packet every 1/10th of a second when enabled)
	- If you want to enable the position update packet, apply the optional sql '2017_02_25_bots_update_position_with_timer_rule.sql' file located in the utils/sql/git/bots/optional sub-directory. This will apply a 'true' rule..but, it can be changed as desired
	- This appears to help with/eliminate rubber banding

== 02/23/2017 ==
** THIS NOTE HAS BEEN SUPERCEDED ON 02/26/2017 **
Uleat: Moved bot spell casting chance values into database - this will allow admins to tailor their bots without having to rebuild server code
	- Each entry uses a 4-dimensional identifier: [spell type index][class index][stance index][conditional index]
		- [spell type index] is not the SpellType_## bit value..use SpellType_##Index instead
		- [class index] values of 0-15 are valid and determined by subtracting 1 from the actual class value
		- [stance index] is a direct correlation (0-6)
		- the [conditional index] is currently predicated on 2 compounded boolean states:
			- not primary healer/not primary slower: 0
			- primary healer/not primary slower: 1
			- not primary healer/ primary slower: 2
			- primary healer/primary slower: 3
	- Valid `value` entries are 0-100..though, the field accepts up to 255... Anything above 100 is clamped to 100 upon loading, however
	- Not all conditions are currently coded and changing a field may not produce any results
	- The 'default' database values will be changed and tweaked as bot spell code modifications occur

== 02/20/2017 ==
Uleat: Reworked bard bot spell twisting and updated their spell (song) list
Uleat: Added ability to shift to pre-combat song buffing by selecting a non-pet npc target, eliminating the need to mix all bard buff songs together

== 2/19/2017 ==
Akkadius: Added a fix for limiting the amount of items sold in a stack when the resulting return coin is higher than the supporting struct for returning coin

== 01/31/2017 ==
Uleat: Modifed bot movement behavior in an attempt to 'normalize' it. This is a hack fix and will be revisited at some point. (Probably just need a follow function rather than use movement, when the leader of the follow chain is moving.)

== 01/26/2017 ==
Uleat: Change rogue bot behavior to eliminate twirling combat. They will only get behind the mob if they are not the mob's target or if the mob is feared or fleeing. This may lower rogue bot dps a small fraction..but, is more in-line with realistic game mechanics.

== 01/17/2017 ==
Mackal: Combat Revamp
	- This change brings melee combat into line with how combat is done on live.
	- This correctly applies the PC damage tables and corrects stacking order of many spells
	- Given the scope of what had to be rewritten, it was not feasible to preserve the old combat system.
	This means you will likely have to rebalance your server, which sucks, but this is very
	accurate so shouldn't require any more changes, at least none that would cause you to have
	to rebalance your server again.
	- For rebalancing, I would recommend running the optional SQL and tweaking from there.
	- To help with rebalancing there is a simulator included at utils/combat-sim.
	- You can enter the mitigation or offense values you would like to balance around (#showstats will show you them)
	a 1 on the sim is min damage 20 is max.
	- Quick recommendations for best ways to improve PC DPS, give them some worn (or AA) SE_DamageModifier and/or SE_MinDamageModifier
== 12/03/2016 ==
Uleat: Added hack detection to trade code
	- If illegal items are found in trade slots when the 'trade' button is clicked, the trade is cancelled and a message is sent to the offending player
	- Future revisions will, at a minimum, log the player as a hacker once the quirks have been worked out

== 12/01/2016 ==
Uleat: Disabled RoF+ clients from augmenting items not in their possessions slots (0-29, 9999, 251-330) to abate an exploit in the current code

== 10/17/2016 ==
Uleat: Moved namespace ItemField from item_instance.h to shareddb.cpp - the only place it is used
Uleat: Separated class Inventory from item_instance files into inventory_profile files
Uleat: Renamed class Inventory to EQEmu::InventoryProfile
Uleat: Renamed enum class InventoryVersion to MobVersion

== 10/16/2016 ==
Uleat: Renamed struct EQEmu::ItemBase to EQEmu::ItemData and class ItemInst to EQEmu::ItemInstance
Uleat: Added class EQEmu::InventorySlot. Re-attached pertinent inventory token references to EQDictionary

== 10/15/2016 ==
Uleat: Changed filenames to facilitate future inventory naming conventions

== 10/09/2016 ==
Noudess: Rogue usage of merchants while utilizing sneak was limited to
temporary items, as the code that checked faction per item sold did not
take into account that rogue was sneaking.  Now sneaking rogues can see full
inventory on merchants (well, unless an item requires a + faction value).

== 09/12/2016 ==
Akkadius: Massive overhaul of the update system and EQEmu Server management utility framework
	(known as eqemu_update.pl) now known as eqemu_server.pl
	- eqemu_server.pl is now a general EQEmu Server management utiltiy framework that can be used
		to extend to many purposes. It's main purpose is to simplify server management
	- eqemu_server.pl changes:
		- Menu has been completely changed, instead of a number based (enter number and hit enter)
		you now type commands within the menu (Ex: 'database')
		- Handles last mile installation for Windows Servers (See Github Readme)
		- Handles last mile installation for Linux Servers (See Github Readme)
			- Ubuntu
			- Debian
			- Fedora
			- CentOS
		- Now checks for Internet connection before performing web requests
		- Database:
			- Regular schema updates now happen automatically, if new binaries present updated
				database schema changes, script will backup first, auto update database, and continue
				world bootup
			- Regular bots database schema changes now happen automatically similarily to the above
			- Database checks can also be ran manually via the script menu
		- CLI Arguments
			- Arguments passed to eqemu_server.pl can execute the same name-based operations that
				are present in the interactive menu
					- Example: "perl eqemu_server.pl opcodes" will download opcodes
					- Example: "perl eqemu_server.pl backup_player_tables" will backup and export player tables
		- Bots
			- Bots can now be automatically setup in Linux or Windows via the 'setup_bots' command
				- Windows will auto download binaries and install, along with installing bots db schema
				- Linxu will auto compile binaries and install, along with installings bots db schema
		- Utility scripts
			- Linux now has the following utility scripts for download, available via menu 'utility_scripts'
				and via Linux default install:
					- server_launcher.pl
					- server_start_dev.sh
					- server_start.sh
					- server_status.sh
					- server_stop.sh
		- Usage analytics
			- eqemu_server.pl now collects usage analytics, this is very helpful for our developers
				- Example: We can see how many installs have been performed:
					https://github.com/EQEmu/Server#server-installs
				- This helps us see how often certain utilities are used as well
		- Console Messages
			- All script messages have been prefixed with a bracket action Ex: [Update] [Database] [Info]
				to be more consistent with our log conventions
		- 'New Server' Utility
			- Running 'new_server' from the main menu or 'perl eqemu_server.pl new_server' while in
				a completely new folder with just the script present, will allow a server operator
				to initiate a full clean PEQ install in that folder. Pulling down all assets and
				installing a PEQ database with the name the server operator gives the prompts in the
				script

noudess: Task system experience based on a % of a level did not take into
account the hell levels rule.  Now it does.

== 09/04/2016 (Changes over past few months) ==
Akkadius: Fixed an issue where clients would crash with health marquee's
Akkadius: Fixed issues with NPC's "ghosting" when they path
Akkadius: Overhauled worldserver logging
Akkadius: Pets now don't actually spawn until the player has fully entered the zone (Live-like)
demonstar/KLS: Adjusted some background workings on how spell buff tics are synced with the client
Uleat: Optimizations to map loading and zone times
Uleat/Akkadius: Fixed bandolier exploit where you could equip a 2H and Shield
mackal: Re-worked spell re-use timer logic
mackal: Source optimizations all over, crash fixes
mackal: Fixed some issues with illusions on zoning
mackal: Fixed some client DOT stacking bugs
mackal: Invis will now break on AA spell casts and item cast
mackal: Changed how Loot response code works
mackal: Implemented 3 additional spell gems with (Mnemonic Retention)
mackal: Instant spells now have instrument mods
mackal: Rate limit character saves
mackal: Made it so items no longer do TGB (Live-like) Rule implemented to disable
mackal: Set pet buffs limit to 30

== 09/03/2016 ==
Uleat: Changed 'Bind Wound' behavior to match the best references that I could find for post-2004 era.
	Note: If you wish to retain the old method, source in the optional '2016_09_03_old_bind_wound_rule.sql' script file.

== 08/27/2016 ==
Kinglykrab: Added optional IP-based account exemptions.
	- To use this system simply set World:EnableIPExemptions to true and create an entry in the ip_exemptions table.
	- Example: exemption_ip of IP 192.168.1.4 in ip_exemptions with exemption_amount of 1 will allow only 1 account to login from IP 192.168.1.4.
	- Note: If there is no exemption, the amount of accounts logged in from a singular IP will default to World:MaxClientsPerIP

== 08/23/2016 ==
noudess: Force mobs on a depop @ end pathgrid to still do this on idle zones.
This makes them be more random after a zone is idle, rather than always showing
up at start point when 1st person logs into an idle zone.  Much more like live.
I dion't think this will be much of a performance problem.  Once they path and
depop, no mkore cpu usage.

== 08/14/2016 ==
mackal: Implement Linked Spell Reuse Timers
	- For whatever reason this is a bit unfriendly, but that's how it is on live.
	- Titanium is especially unfriendly with large differences in reuse times (ex higher canni and the first 4)
	- Unsure when this went live for spells, but canni was at least linked at OoW launch

== 08/13/2016 ==
Kinglykrab: Implemented optional avoidance cap rules.
	- Serves to eliminate God-like characters on custom servers with high item stats
	- Rule Names:
		- Character:EnableAvoidanceCap (default is false)
		- Character:AvoidanceCap (default is 750, beyond 1,000 seems to make characters dodge all attacks)

== 08/02/2016 ==
Uleat: Changed 'SendZoneSpawnsBulk' behavior to use near/far criteria (live-like) when sending packets.
	- Zone-to-Zone client loading will see a small decrease in time (less than 10~15%)
	- World-to-Zone client loading appears to greatly benefit from this (tested 'devastation' - pre-change: ~22 seconds, post-change: 12~15 seconds)
	- This change does not affect the final spawning of mobs in the client

== 07/31/2016 ==
mackal: Implement more spell gems!
	- There are a few things still left to due like make dealing with losing gems nice (reset AAs, going to an older client etc)
	- Sadly SoF disc release doesn't support gem 10 like one might expect :(
	- So changed clients:
		- SoD = 10
		- UF = 12
		- RoF/RoF2 = 12. I know the UI supports 16, but the client does not and can cause client crashes
	- The quest APIs assume you pass a valid spell gem ...

Uleat: Implemented zone memory-mapped file usage
	- Zone map files are converted to pre-loaded binary files, bypassing the (sometimes) time-consuming raw data transform process
	- There are three ways to convert files:
			-- Do nothing! The zone bootup process will check for a mmf file and load it, if found, or create it after the 'normal' transform process is complete
			-- Use the command line option: zone convert_map <zone_name>.map (for singular conversions)
			-- Drop the 'convert_maps_to_mmfs.pl' into your server directory and execute it for a batch conversion
			-- Note: Any zone maps not pre-converted will be processed once a zone is booted up that does not have one
	- To enable this feature, you must have the 'USE_MAP_MMFS' option checked in cmake and have built binaries on that
	- To disable this feature, or if you encouter problems, disable the 'USE_MAP_MMFS' option and rebuild your binaries
	- This feature will test the validity of your zlib library. If you get errors/crashes upon conversion, then your zlib1.dll is most likely suspect (check our forum for solutions)

mackal: Fix up the SpellBuff struct
	- THERE MAYBE BUGS
	- there shouldn't though, most of the hackery was from badly named fields causing confusion

== 07/09/2016 ==
Uleat: Important fix for mob pathing
	- This should fix failed pathing issues (and high cpu usage for zone.exe) for mobs in affect zones
	- Changed variable 'gridno' type from int16 to int32 to reflect actual return value of fetch (values do exceed 32767 aka int16.max)
	- Precision loss from int32 to int16 conversion was causing grid id to be changed to quest controlled movement in cases where (gridno & 0x8000 == true)

== 06/28/2016 ==
Noudess: Resurrection effects now block certain buffs like on live.
Noudess: Added message about why spells are blocked (rule based)

Uleat: Reworked EQEmuDictionary to use class LookupEntry

== 06/01/2016 ==
Uleat: Implemented EQEmu::TintProfile
Uleat: Implemented EQEmu::TextureProfile

== 05/31/2016 ==
Uleat: Converted enumeration MaterialSlots to EQEmu::textures::TextureSlot

== 05/28/2016 ==
Uleat: Merged client_version and inventory_version into emu_versions files

== 05/27/2016 ==
Uleat: Renamed EQEmu::Item_Struct to EQEmu::ItemBase (and appropriate files) to coincide with new inventory naming conventions

== 05/25/2016 ==
Uleat: Renamed and moved enumeration SkillUseTypes to EQEmu::skill::SkillType - added class EQEmu::SkillProfile, though not implemented at this time
Uleat: Some more work on eq_dictionary

== 05/21/2016 ==
Uleat: Moved struct Item_Struct into namespace EQEmu along with associated enumerations - enumerations into namespace EQEmu::item (run shared_memory)
Uleat: Fixed a few possible crash points in linux builds associated with augments/ornamentations

== 05/18/2016 ==
Uleat: Changed client 'constants' files to 'limits'

== 05/10/2016 ==
Uleat: Converted client translators' 'SerializeItem()' to recursive, single buffer methodology. Titanium SerializeItem() now adds a null term between parent items instead of the invoking function
Uleat: Converted server 'BulkSendInventoryItems()' to use single buffer methodology
Uleat: Added 'ItemInst::Serialize()' overload to make use of the above single buffer methodology

== 05/08/2016 ==
Uleat: Re-coded Titanium client translator 'SerializeItem()' to use coded property assignments over file enumerated ones

== 04/22/2016 ==
Uleat: Reworked ClientVersion into namespace EQEmu; Added InventoryVersion
Uleat: Delinked current inventory slot enumeration and constants from EQEmu::constants and global definition (inv2 pre-work)

== 04/19/2016 ==
Uleat: Changed the recent EQEmu rework to eliminate the nested class design (possible cause of VS2015 update crashes - unverified)
Uleat: Some more inv2 convergence work

== 04/15/2016 ==
Uleat: Reworked EQDictionary into namespace EQEmu

== 04/08/2016 ==
Uleat: Added Heal Rotation HOTs (Heal Override Targets) that can be set for proactive healing (default HR behavior is reactive)
Uleat: Added the ability to save/load/delete Heal Rotations based on targeted member - load is automatic when ^hrcreate is used on a bot that has a saved HR entry

== 04/07/2016 ==
Uleat: Rework of eq_dictionary to facilitate inventory work

== 04/05/2016 ==
Uleat: Moved database query code out of bot.cpp and into the new BotDatabase class

== 03/25/2016 ==
Uleat: Fix for heal rotation 'Stack Overflow' error
Kayen: Defensive procs will now only proc once per attack round (instead of every attack chance).
       Live like modifier added that decreases defensive proc chance if you are higher level then your attacker.

== 03/24/2016 ==
Kayen: Fix for AE taunt to use correct range and hate modifier.
       Fix for spell effect version of taunt to use correct range.
Uleat: Activation of new 'Bots' command system
	- You will need to re-run cmake to capture the file additions and then re-compile your server binaries
	- You will also need to manually run eqemu_update.pl and select the bots update option - you should have 2 pending updates: 9001 & 9002
	- The new command system is accessed with the '^' character - start with '^help' and see where that takes you
	- More information can be found on the eqemu forums

== 03/05/2016 ==
mackal: Implement extra bind points (secondary recall)
	For SE_Gate, base2 is which bind to use (starting at 1)
	For SE_BindAffinity, base1 is which bind to set (starting at 1)
	For SE_GateCastersBindpoint, base1 is which bind to use (starting at 1)
		There was actually no spells that don't send to the main bind, but it uses a base1 of 1 which matches with SE_Gate
		This also doesn't break anything

== 03/01/2016 ==
Uleat: Fix for LDoN treasure 'npcs' not leaving a corpse (please report any issues..)

== 02/29/2016 ==
Uleat: Change in AddItemBonuses - now includes ammo slot for skill mods only. Defined SoD- client SkillModMax packet property (client does not show..but, does enforce.)

== 02/11/2016 ==
Hateborne: Added IgnoreSpellDmgLvlRestriction rule (boolean) to ignore the 5 level spread when checking to add SpellDmg

== 02/10/2016 ==
Hateborne: Added FlatItemExtraSpellAmt rule (boolean) to allow SpellDmg on items to be added as raw damage versus scaled.

== 01/26/2016 ==
Uleat: Fix for Berserker 'Piercing' skill issues. Server Admins: If you run custom skill sets, this patch touches the code segments that you will need to modify if you have changed the default berserker 1H-/2H-piercing skill values.
Uleat (Daerath): Fix for precision-loss item weight conversions in older clients.
	- WARNING: YOU MUST RE-RUN SHARED_MEMORY.EXE BEFORE STARTING SERVER OR ITEM LOSS WILL OCCUR!
	- Note: Cmake must be re-run to include/exclude the required files

== 01/13/2016 ==
Kinglykrab: Modified #flag so you can refresh your target's account status (GM status level) without them having to relog.
	- Just target the person whose flag you want to refresh and type #flag.
Uleat: Added itemlink functionality to the #summonitem command. Current use is limited to extracting the item id from the link.
	- Invoking by item link '#summonitem Arrow' produces the same result as by item id '#summonitem 8005'

== 01/12/2016 ==
Athrogate: Adding ClearCompassMark() to Lua.
	- Lua didn't have ClearCompassMark().  Perl already had this.

== 01/12/2016 ==
Uleat: Fix for tradeskill containers remaining locked after a RoF+ client leaves. Intermediary fix for RoF+ clients accessing tradeskill containers when in use by another player (thanks Natedog!)

== 12/29/2015 ==
Akkadius: Implemented standardized zone controller scripts (Rule Zone, UseZoneController) Defaulted to true
	- When a zone boots, it will spawn an invisible npc by the name of zone_controller
	- Lua and Perl scripts can be represented with this npc as zone_controller.pl/lua
	- This NPC's ID is ruled be define ZONE_CONTROLLER_NPC_ID 10
	- Two EVENT's uniquely are handled with this NPC/controller (They only work with the zone_controller NPC)
		- EVENT_SPAWN_ZONE :: All NPC spawns in the zone trigger the controller and pass the following variables:
			$spawned_entity_id
			$spawned_npc_id
		- EVENT_DEATH_ZONE :: All NPC deaths in the zone trigger the controller event and pass the following variables:
			$killer_id
			$killer_damage
			$killer_spell
			$killer_skill
			$killed_npc_id

== 12/28/2015 ==
Kinglykrab: Added GetInstanceTimer() to Perl and Lua.
	- Added GetInstanceTimerByID(instance_id) to Perl and Lua.
	- Note: If you do not provide an instance id in the method it defaults to instance id 0 and returns 0 for time remaining.
	- Added UpdateZoneHeader(type, value) to Perl and Lua.
	- Note: UpdateZoneHeader allows you to manipulate fog color, fog density, and many other zone header settings on the fly in Perl and Lua.

== 12/21/2015 ==
Natedog: Updated item table fields and added a few missing fields for evolving items
	-DO NOT implement Heirloom items till the inventory code is fixed to allow placing NO DROP
		items in your shared bank. (but item field located on items table)
	-NYI - SkillModMax: Max skill point modification from the percent mods. EX:
		100% 2HSlashing (Max 50) - can only increase 2hslash by 50 MAX! (item field located though)
Kinglykrab: Added GetMeleeMitigation() for NPCs and Clients in Perl and Lua.
	- This allows you to check total item, spell, and AA melee mitigation contribution.

== 12/19/2015 ==
Kinglykrab: Added many methods to Perl and Lua, list below:
	- SeeInvisible()
	- SeeInvisibleUndead()
	- SeeHide()
	- SeeImprovedHide()
	- GetNimbusEffect1() - returns first nimbus effect
	- GetNimbusEffect2() - returns second nimbus effect
	- GetNimbusEffect3() - returns third nimbus effect
	- IsTargetable()
	- HasShieldEquiped()
	- HasTwoHandBluntEquiped()
	- HasTwoHanderEquiped()
	- GetHerosForgeModel() - returns int32 Hero's Forge model
	- IsEliteMaterialItem() - returns uint32 Hero's Forge Model
	- GetBaseSize() - returns Mob's base size
	- HasOwner()
	- IsPet()
	- HasPet()
	- IsSilenced()
	- IsAmnesiad()

== 12/16/2015 ==
Noudess: Repaired issue with Bind Wounds on someone else.  Message was not coming out on client (hold still) and a bind wounds on someone already binding their wounds would interrupt their bind and make them stand.  Also removed some duplicate messaging.

== 12/14/2015 ==
Kinglykrab: Added IsBlind() and IsFeared() functionality to Perl and Lua.
	- Note: Both methods are Mob methods and may be used on NPCs or PCs.
Natedog: Added Discipline functions, UpdateInstanceTimer function, and UnmemSpellBySpellID to lua and perl
	-Examples: http://wiki.eqemulator.org/i?M=Pastebin&Paste=BJ0ygmNM

== 12/07/2015 ==
Uleat: Command aliases are no longer handled through the command_add() function.
	- To add a command alias, edit the database table `command_settings` - here, you will find three columns: `command`, `access` and `aliases`
	- Adding command aliases require that the command contain an entry in `command_settings`.`command`
	- Only 'real' commands go inside of the command_init() function in command.cpp .. if you wish to add aliases, you must enter them into the database
	- 'Real' commands are loaded first .. then any access/alias data is loaded and applied afterwards
	- Duplicate aliases will be ignored .. only the first encountered occurrence will be honored - if it does not conflict with an existing command name
	- Aliases should not contain whitespace and should be '|' (pipe) delimited
	- The restriction on the number of aliases has been removed .. though each alias will still be limited to the access level of the parent command
	- If you need need more name space for aliases, simply edit the `command_settings` table and increase the size of the `aliases` column
	- The old `commands` table has been renamed to `commands_old` for reference
	- All of the current 'standard' commands have been added to the new `command_settings` table

	- YOU WILL NEED TO VERIFY/IMPORT OLD ACCESS VALUES AS THIS CHANGE REVERTS ALL COMMAND ACCESS VALUES TO THEIR PEQDB DEFAULTS

== 11/30/2015 ==
Uleat: Changed criteria for a few bots scripts from count to null/not null in hopes of fixing special case failures

== 11/22/2015 ==
Uleat: Fix for loginserver project compile failure

== 11/7/2015 ==
Akkadius: Implemented #repopclose [distance in units] - Used for development purposes, defaults to 500 units
	- Real case use: Large zones with 700 NPC's and you are making fast quick tweaks to nearby NPC's you can refresh just the NPC's around you instead of all in the zone
	- This can be quite the time saver
	- This command will depop all NPC's and only respawn the NPC's that are 500 units around you or unless you specify otherwise

== 11/2/2015 ==
Akkadius: Performance boost (exponential) - Adjusted default idle cast check timers in rules
	- Spells:AI_IdleNoSpellMinRecast	500 (Now 6000) 6 seconds
	- Spells:AI_IdleNoSpellMaxRecast	2000 (Now 60000) 60 seconds
	- Database version 9089 will take care of this update automatically only if you used the default values
	- The CPU cost of NPC's checking the entire entity list to cast beneficial spells (Heals/Buffs) becomes extremely high when higher NPC count zones exist (Based off of process profiling)
			- Distance checks for every single NPC to every single other NPC who are casting beneficial spells occur every .5 - 2 seconds unless npc_spells dictates other values, which most of the time it does not
	- Zones that once fluctuated from 1-8% CPU with no activity (Idle but players present) now idle at .5% based on my testings due
		to this change in conjunction with the past few performance commits, these are zones that have 600-800 NPC's in them
	- These values normally are overidden by the spells table (npc_spells), fields (idle_no_sp_recast_min, idle_no_sp_recast_max)

== 11/1/2015 ==
Akkadius: Made many performance optimizing oriented code changes in the source
	- Added Rate limit the rate in which signals are processed for NPC's (.5 seconds instead of .01 seconds)
Akkadius: Added Perl Export Settings which should heavily reduce the Perl footprint
	- Normally when any sub EVENT_ gets triggered, all kinds of variables have to get exported every single time an event is triggered and
		this can make Perl very slow when events are triggered constantly
			- The two most taxing variable exports are the item variables ($itemcount{} $hasitem{} $oncursor{}) and qglobals ($qglobals{})
			- qglobals can pose to be an issue quickly when global qglobals build up, it is highly recommend to use the GetGlobal() and SetGlobal()
				methods instead as they don't reference the hashmap $qglobals{} that is rebuilt every single time a sub event is triggered
	- A stress test conducted with 10,000 samples shows an excess of time taken to export variables: http://i.imgur.com/NEpW1tS.png
	- After the Perl Export Settings table is implemented, and all exports are shut off you see the following test result:
		http://i.imgur.com/Du5hth9.png
	- The difference of eliminating uneeded exports brings the overhead and footprint of 10,000 triggers from 54 seconds to 2 seconds
	- In a 10,000 sample test (10,000 sub event triggers), exporting item variables adds 12 seconds alone, when item variables are only needed in
		EVENT_ITEM and EVENT_SAY a majority of the time if at all
	- In a 10,000 sample test (10,000 sub event triggers), exporting qglobals with approximately 1,000 global qglobals in the database creates
		about 11-20 seconds of delay on its own (Depending on hardware of course)
	- I've written a parser that has determined which of these exports are needed in which sub routines and have turned off all of the unneeded
		exports in sub routines that do not need them and used it to create the default table that will be installed in the database.
	- The export table is called 'perl_event_export_settings' and it resembles the following structure and contains all current 81 EVENTS
		- If an entry doesn't exist in this table and a new subroutine is added to the source, all exports will be on by default for that routine

	+----------+-----------------------------------------+-----------------+------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+
	| event_id | event_description                       | export_qglobals | export_mob | export_zone | export_item | export_event |
	+----------+-----------------------------------------+-----------------+------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+
	|        0 | EVENT_SAY                               |               1 |          1 |           1 |           1 |            1 |
	|        1 | EVENT_ITEM                              |               1 |          1 |           1 |           0 |            1 |
	|        2 | EVENT_DEATH                             |               1 |          1 |           1 |           0 |            1 |
	|        3 | EVENT_SPAWN                             |               1 |          1 |           1 |           0 |            1 |
	|        4 | EVENT_ATTACK                            |               0 |          1 |           1 |           0 |            1 |
	|        5 | EVENT_COMBAT                            |               1 |          1 |           1 |           0 |            1 |
	+----------+-----------------------------------------+-----------------+------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+

	- If a change is made to this table while the server is live and running, you can hot reload all zone process settings via:
		#reloadperlexportsettings
	- For those who wonder what "exports" are, they are reference to variables that are made available at runtime of the sub event, such as:
		(export_qglobals) (Heavy) : $qglobals https://github.com/EQEmu/Server/blob/master/zone/embparser.cpp#L916
		(export_item) (Heavy) : $itemcount{} $hasitem{} $oncursor{} https://github.com/EQEmu/Server/blob/master/zone/embparser.cpp#L1103
		(export_zone) : $zoneid, $instanceid, $zoneln etc. https://github.com/EQEmu/Server/blob/master/zone/embparser.cpp#L1083
		(export_mob) : $x, $y, $z, $h, $hpratio etc. https://github.com/EQEmu/Server/blob/master/zone/embparser.cpp#L1032
		(export_event) : (event specific) IE: EVENT_SAY ($text) https://github.com/EQEmu/Server/blob/master/zone/embparser.cpp#L1141

Uleat: Implemented 'bots' database versioning
Note: See thread for more information: http://www.eqemulator.org/forums/showthread.php?t=40091

Kayen: Feign death will now break when hit by casted spells, consisted with live.
Implemented suport for AA/spell effect which provides a chance to avoid FD breaking from spells.

== 10/10/2015 ==
Kayen: Updated mechanics to be consistent with live regarding how invisible breaks when the client is the target of a spell.
Invisible will drop whenever a client is hit with a detrimental spell, regardless of if resisted, if it does damage or AOE.
Hide skill now also follows the same rules as above.
Implemented support for Rogue AA - Nerves of Steel which gives a chance for hide NOT to break
when client is hit with an AOE spell.

== 09/25/2015 ==
Uleat: Implemented 'Inventory Snapshot' feature to track online player inventories at timed intervals.
rules:
	'Character:ActiveInvSnapshots'			- active (true) or inactive (false - default)
	'Character:InvSnapshotMinIntervalM'		- minimum time between snapshots (in minutes)
	'Character:InvSnapshotMinRetryM'		- minimum time to attempt a retry after a failed snapshot (in minutes)
	'Character:InvSnapshotHistoryD'			- minimum time to keep snapshot entries (in days)
commands:
	'#invsnapshot'						- Takes a snapshot of target client's inventory (feature active or inactive)
	'#clearinvsnapshots [use rule]'		- Clears snapshot entries based on bool argument ([true] - honors the 'InvSnapshotHistoryD' rule, [false] - erases all)

== 08/02/2015 ==
Shendare: VS2013 query StringFormat glitches when "%f" is passed for the int GetRunSpeed().
Shendare: In CreateNewNPCCommand(), the npc_type_id and spawngroupid are created in the database, but never set in the spawn class, so later it can't delete them with #npcspawn remove or #npcspawn delete.

Hateborne: 	Added optional ability to enforce task level requirements in perl and lua via an added, optional parameter to $client->AssignTask and quest::assigntask.
		Use cases:
			quest::assigntask(703); # this still assigns the task as normal, no functional change
			quest::assigntask(703, 1); # this will assign the task, provided the character meets the db-stored level requirements
			$client->AssignTask(703, $npc->GetID()); # still assigns the task as normal, no functional change
			$client->AssignTask(703, $npc->GetID(), 1); # this will assign the task, provided the character meets the db-stored level requirements

mackal: Implement Triple Attack Skill
	Parses showed about rand(1000) for the chance, may need more investigating
	Corrected Double Attack chances as well
	Running optional 2015_07_06_TripleAttack.sql will set current toons to their max skill
	This is optional because the admins might want to go a different route.

== 07/05/2015 ==
mackal: Rewrite NPC combat attack round logic
	An NPC "quading" is really just an NPC with innate dual wield that doubles on both hands
	The old rules allowed NPCs to hit 6 times in one round
	NPCs also seem to have their own skill progression for DW/DA
	See: http://www.eqemulator.org/forums/showthread.php?t=38708
	You can set Combat:UseLiveCombatRounds to false to use the old rules
	PC Double Attack rates kind of follow the same thing but still needs to be implemented
Kinglykrab: WARNING: summonburriedplayercorpse is now summonburiedplayercorpse, getplayerburriedcorpsecount is now getplayerburiedcorpsecount, summon_burried_player_corpse is now summon_buried_player_corpse, and get_player_burried_corpse_count is now get_player_buried_corpse_count FIX THESE IN YOUR SCRIPTS OR THEY WILL NOT WORK!!!!
	Added bot saylinks (thanks Uleat!)
	Command aliases for #augmentitem (#aug), #findnpctype (#fn), #findspell (#fs)
	Bot command changes: #bot sow -> #bot speed, #bot magepet -> #bot setpet, #bot resurrectme -> #bot resurrect
	Changed all occurrences of burried to buried in the code.
	client_packet.cpp was referencing old columns in character_corpses, not sure how we didn't already see this before.

KLS/mackal: AA system has been rewritten fixing a ton of bugs and extending functionality while making it easier to create new AA points.
KLS/mackal: New tables are needed and so older data will need to be migrated to the new system.
KLS/mackal: The SQL saves the old aa points spent/avail/character_alt_abilities data if any server ops want to do something different than PEQ did with it.
KLS/mackal: Will try to get a wiki entry written up next week some time explaining the system but it's really not hard to follow the db tables in the meantime.

	- If update_world is false, the zone will then unsubscribe itself from regular worldserver time synchronizations
	- Basically this localizes the zones time and keeps it from syncing with world updates
Akkadius: Added DB ver 9082 with update to add npc_types texture columns if table does not currently have them

== 05/22/2015 ==
Uleat: Added null-term declaration for character names in ENCODE(OP_CharInfo) - where appropriate

== 05/20/2015 ==
mackal: Bard instrument mods should be more consistent with live. Zoning will keep instrument mod for long duration buffs (selo's)
	Still need to have procs/doom effects to inherit the instrument mods from their source buff/whatever

== 05/18/2015 ==
KLS: Changed how fishing locates water to hopefully be a bit more accurate at the expense of a bit more cpu power per line cast.

== 05/15/2015 ==
Uleat: Added check to EntityList::CheckSpawnQueue() to bypass dereference if returned iterator is npc_list.end() - should fix the debug assertion failure crash

== 04/30/2015 ==
mackal: Implement mob and client melee push
       You can set Combat:MeleePush to false to turn off or change Combat:MeleePushChance to increase the chance an NPC can be pushed
       PCs are always pushed, need to do more testing to verify.

== 04/22/2015 ==
Uleat: Probable fix for 'Debug Assertion Failure' in Client::GarbleMessage() when calling the 'isalpha' macro.
ref: https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/932876/calling-isdigit-with-a-signed-char-1-results-in-a-assert-failure-in-debug-compiles

== 03/29/2015 ==
Secrets: Identified the Target Ring fields for RoF/RoF2.
Secrets: Added a perl accessor for the last target ring position received from the client. Usage: $client->GetTargetRingX(), $client->GetTargetRingY(), $client->GetTargetRingZ()

== 03/12/2015 ==
Akkadius: [eqemu_update.pl V7] Add Option 9) LUA Modules - Download latest LUA Modules (Required for Lua)

== 03/10/2015 ==
Akkadius: [eqemu_update.pl] Add Option 6) Download Latest map and water files

== 03/04/2015 ==
Akkadius: Fix Spell Book Deletion

== 03/03/2015 ==
Uleat: Fix for 'Invalid Slot ID' messages. Bag slot count is now enforced during database saves to eliminate existing 'hidden' duplicated items..sorry MQ2 users...
Uleat: Fix for Item loss during corpse looting and possible item loss when purchasing items from LDoN or Adventure merchants. (cursor-related)

== 02/27/2015 ==
Uleat: Final 'tweak' for light sources until a valid issue arises. Wearable equipment now matches client behavior. Stackable light sources are bugged in the client..but, the current timer update implementation alleviates this condition.

== 02/26/2015 ==
Uleat: Updated light source criteria to (hopefully) match what the client uses (still needs tweaking)
Uleat: Changed 'general' light source checks to accept the last valid light source (client behavior)
Notes:
	- "Fire Beetle Eyes" are still causing issues in general slots (no item movement sound effect)
	- Wearable equipment types still register as valid light sources when in general slots (needs exemption criteria)

== 02/23/2015 ==
Noudess: Allow for a rule to set starting swimming && SenseHeading value.
I moved the swimming override to char create instead of setting it
every time a char enters a zone.

Also added rules to not ignore, but rather forrce sense heading packets to be
used to train it instead of maxing it out like before.

Uleat: Fix for RoF+ clients showing active 'Return Home' button when action is not available (swapped 'GoHome' and 'Enabled' fields in RoF-era CharacterSelectEntry structs)

== 02/21/2015 ==
Noudess: Starting erudites that were supposed to start in paineel were landing in erudin on Titanium. Fixed to be paineel.

== 02/20/2015 ==
mackal: Implement claims for RoF/RoF2 (should no longer crash the client!)
	- fixed bugs related to claims for the rest of the clients (woo infinite loops)

== 02/18/2015 ==
Trevius: Fix for potential recursive loops if using RemoveFromHateList() within EVENT_HATE_LIST.

== 02/17/2015 ==
Uleat: Implemented per-client character creation limiting. Caps are unknown atm..so, don't get over-zealous!
Notes:
	- Titanium is hard-coded to min/max of 8 in both the server and client translator code (client doesn't support variations in available character count)
	- SoF thru RoF2 have had their max characters raised to 12 from 10
	- Changing the number of characters per account is accomplished by:
		1) Setting consts::CHARACTER_CREATION_LIMIT to the desired count in the client's constants file in ../common/patches/
		2) Ensuring that eq_dictionary's EmuConstants::CHARACTER_CREATION_LIMIT is equal-greater than the client's new value..referencing is good
		3) Recompiling the server code
	- A rules-based qualifier may be added at some point

== 02/16/2015 ==
Trevius: (RoF2) Bazaar Trading (Buying/Selling) is now fully functional.  Bazaar (/bazaar) search is not yet functional.
mackal: (RoF2) Send the bard focus effects, note custom servers will need to fix their items, server side we still use the old system, but RoF2 wasn't showing anything with not sending focus, so send them

== 02/14/2015 ==
Trevius: (RoF2) Bazaar is now partially functional.  RoF2 clients can start/end trader mode and other clients can purchase from them.  No other functionality yet.
Uleat: Implemented higher bandolier and potion belt counts for clients that support it..you will still need to activate them through the proper aa's, etc...

== 02/12/2015 ==
Akkadius: Implement zone based gravity, required SQL DB change
	- To test `zone` table `gravity` values, change the value and use #zheader <zoneshortname> to test

== 02/11/2015 ==
Trevius: (RoF+) Bandolier no longer displays a Treasure Chest Icon when no Bandoliers are set.

== 02/09/2015 ==
Trevius: (RoF+) Setting Alt flag on characters in the Guild Management Window is now saved and functional for filtering.
Trevius: (RoF+) Guild Invites between RoF+ and previous Clients is now functional.

== 02/08/2015 ==
Kayen: Implemented npc specialability (44) COUNTER_AVOID_DAMAGE which when applied to the ATTACKING NPC will make their attacks more difficult to be avoided by riposte/dodge/parry/block.
Parama0: Negative modifer value that affects ALL avoid damage types dodge/parry/riposte/block) chance on defender. Ie (44,50 = 50 pct reduction to ALL)
Parama1: Negative modifer value that affects RIPOSTE chance on defender. Ie (44,1,0,50 = 50 pct reduction to riposte chance)
Parama2: Negative modifer value that affects PARRY chance on defender.  Ie (44,1,0,0,50 = 50 pct reduction to parry chance)
Parama3: Negative modifer value that affects BLOCK chance on defender.  Ie (44,1,0,0,0,50 = 50 pct reduction to block chance)
Parama4: Negative modifer value that affects DODGE chance on defender.  e (44,1,0,0,0,0,50 = 50 pct reduction to dodge chance)
Example of usage: Player has Improved Dodge V (+50 pct dodge chance), you want to negate this bonus you would set 44,1,0,0,0,0,50 on your NPC.

== 02/07/2015 ==
Akkadius: Reduced #repop time dramatically by taking down hundreds of individual SELECT/DELETE/INSERT queries in routines and bringing it down to very few
	See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kSFbyTBuAk

== 02/06/2015 ==
Uleat: Updated returns for Inventory and ItemInst const iterators. (const == const)
Uleat: Replaced 'iter_inst' and 'iter_contents' typedefs with their stl definitions
Uleat: Removed 'limbo' from the 'HasItem' series of checks - including lore checks. The client excludes this range and it causes issues when performing item searches - dupe lore checks were added to account for this.
Uleat: Updated command #iteminfo to show light source information and a few other things

== 02/05/2015 ==
Trevius: Fixed Environmental Damage for RoF2.

== 02/03/2015 ==
Trevius: Crashfix for TempName() when numbers are passed at the end of the name.
Uleat: Tweaking of item type exclusions to alleviate strobing conditions with light sources

== 02/02/2015 ==
Akkadius: Implement Packet logs with dumps
	- Category: 41: Packet: Server -> Client With Dump
	- Category: 42: Packet: Server -> Client With Dump
	See: http://wiki.eqemulator.org/p?Logging_System_Overhaul#packet-logging-levels

== 02/01/2015 ==
mackal: Add quest debugging to lua
	eq.debug("Test debug level implicit 1")
	eq.debug("Test debug level explicit 1", 1)
	eq.debug("Test debug level explicit 2", 2)
	eq.debug("Test debug level explicit 3", 3)
Akkadius: Add Packet Logging Categories
	- 5 - Packet: Client -> Server - Logs::Client_Server_Packet
	- 39 - Packet: Server -> Client - Logs::Server_Client_Packet
	- 40 - Packet: Client -> Server Unhandled - Logs::Client_Server_Packet_Unhandled
	See: http://wiki.eqemulator.org/p?Logging_System_Overhaul#packet-logging

== 01/31/2015 ==
Trevius: Fixed FindGroundZ() and GetGroundZ() to once again utilize the X and Y arguments that are passed to them.

== 01/30/2015 ==
Akkadius: Implemented event type "EVENT_ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE"
	- This event triggers when taking any sort of environmental damage. Example use:
	sub EVENT_ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE{
		quest::debug("EVENT_ENVIRONMENTAL_DAMAGE");
		quest::debug("env_damage is " . $env_damage);
		quest::debug("env_damage_type is " . $env_damage_type);
		quest::debug("env_final_damage is " . $env_final_damage);
	}
	Result: (Test falling in Velks): http://i.imgur.com/tPRL7yL.png
	- Implemented LUA counterpart of this same implementation above
Akkadius (Bobaski): Add PoK New Merchant sql/git/optional/2015_01_30_poknowledge_spell_vendors.sql

== 01/29/2015 ==
Trevius: Added more information to Mercenary Logging.
Trevius: Added potential fix for Mercenaries that fail to unsuspend.
Trevius: Added a new "statscale" field to the merc_stats table that can be used to quickly balance Mercenary Stats based on Level.
Trevius: The new "statscale" field now combines with the Mercs::ScaleRate rule value (default 100 percent for both).

== 01/28/2015 ==
Akkadius: Added Logs::DebugQuest category per request from Trevius (Great idea)
	- Exported quest::debug(log_message, [debug_level = 1)
	- Example:
		quest::debug("This is a test debug message, level 1 (default)");
		quest::debug("This is a test debug message, level 1", 1);
		quest::debug("This is a test debug message, level 2", 2);
		quest::debug("This is a test debug message, level 3", 3);

		Result: http://i.imgur.com/6VoafGE.png
	- Uses traditional logging system to output this category
	- Required MySQL Source in Database version 9070

== 01/27/2015 ==
Trevius: Removed "Mercenary Debug:" from the Mercenary Log entries.
Trevius: Resolved duplicate "You have no Mercenaries" messages when zoning without owning a Mercenary.
Trevius: Mercenaries should now always be able to unsuspend if the timer is up.
Trevius: More work on Mercenaries and Grouping to reduce bugs and redundant queries.
Uleat: Finished ClientVersion update to include patch file and namespace updates - don't forget to copy the renamed 'patch_UF.conf' into your eqemu directory.)

== 01/26/2015 ==
Uleat: Changed Corpse::MoveItemToCorpse() to allow 'by address' passing of removed item slot list. Fixed a bug that kept soul-bound items inside of bags from attuning properly

== 01/25/2015 ==
Trevius: Fixed an issue where Mercenaries were causing several DB queries per second while suspended.
Trevius: Added Logs::Mercenaries to the new Logging System.  Logging of Mercenary information is off by default with the required SQL.

== 01/24/2015 ==
Uleat: Added equipment light source functionality to all mob derived classes (may still need tweaking...)
Notes:
	- In addition to equipment light sources, innate npc_type light sources have already been activated
	- Valid light source values are 0 thru 15 (values are bitmask checked and limited to 0x0F)
	- Not all classes handle equipment light sources the same way due to their equipment/loot list configurations
	- Spell (casting?) light sources may be implemented at some point..more information is needed
	- Currently, loot list (general inventory) light sources are limited to ItemTypeMisc and ItemTypeLight to avoid issues with worn-specific light sources emitting
	- Augment light sources are not recognized by the client and, therefore, not implemented in the server code

== 01/22/2015 ==
Akkadius: Massive Log System overhaul, see: http://wiki.eqemulator.org/p?Logging_System_Overhaul&frm=Main

== 01/21/2015 ==
Uleat: Added `light` field to npc_types load query (all six clients tested positive for functionality.)
Note: This only affects 'innate' light. Equipment (other) light is still in-work.
Optional SQL: utils/sql/git/optional/2015_01_21_NPC_Types_Light_Field_Primer.sql

== 01/20/2015 ==
Uleat: Fix for Inventory::_HasItemByUse(bucket) using the parent container when searching for bag container items.

== 01/15/2015 ==
Uleat: Attempted fix for elusive inventory bug:
  - Removed 'iter_queue' typedef and converted lcast to explicit or auto defines
  - Reworked several functions that manipulate the cursor queue
  - Found/corrected one occurrence of post-processing iterator incrementing in an ItemInstQueue handler
  - Added many scope declarations in code that handles inventory manipulation (loose macros are bad...)
Uleat: Added Item_Struct pointer checks to ItemInst methods that did not have them
Uleat: Changed IsEquippable(race,class) to use bit-wise 'and' (&) over '(x%2)==1' in conditional check.
Uleat: Changed DyeArmor() assignment of 'armor_color' to use bit-wise 'or' and bit-shifting (|,<<) over multiplication and addition (*,+).

== 01/13/2015 ==
Uleat: Placed an upper limit on the cursor queue save loop.
Trevius: (RoF2) Guild invites now add new members as members instead of recruits, and /guild chat works properly.
Trevius: (RoF2) Guild Promote is now functional.

== 01/12/2015 ==
Uleat: Fix for OP_FormattedMessage text link server crashes
Uleat: Added text link translators for OP_TaskDescription (RoF+ -- all clients current)

Be sure to run this or there will be item loss:
Required SQL: utils/sql/git/required/2014_12_13_inventory_table_update.sql

== 12/12/2014 ==
mackal: Add special attack 42, Ignore Root Aggro Rules. This allows you to root a mob and have them still use the normal aggro rules (so they will attack the one with most hate, not closest)

== 12/09/2014 ==
Trevius: (RoF+) Implemented Hero's Forge Armor Models for Items.  To use, set herosforgemodel field in the item table to a model number such as 63 (for example).

== 11/16/2014 ==
mackal: fix size issue with ControlBoat_Struct and exploit fix in OP_BoardBoat

Akkadius: Implemented Automatic Database update and versioning system
Akkadius: Created database revision define, this is located in version.h in common #define CURRENT_BINARY_DATABASE_VERSION 9057
	- This revision define will need to be incremented each time a database update is made
	- Along with a revision define increment, you will need to update the db_update manifest located in:
		- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EQEmu/Server/master/utils/sql/db_update_manifest.txt
		- An entry needs to be made at the bottom of the manifest, the entry is quite simple
		- Example: 9057|2014_11_13_spells_new_updates.sql|SHOW COLUMNS FROM `spells_new` LIKE 'disallow_sit'|empty|
			- This latest example is checking to see if the spells_new table contains the column 'disallow_sit', if its empty, the update needs to be ran
				- More examples of match types below:
		# Example: Version|Filename.sql|Query_to_Check_Condition_For_Needed_Update|match type|text to match
		#	0 = Database Version
		#	1 = Filename.sql
		#	2 = Query_to_Check_Condition_For_Needed_Update
		#	3 = Match Type - If condition from match type to Value 4 is true, update will flag for needing to be ran
		#		contains = If query results contains text from 4th value
		#		match = If query results matches text from 4th value
		#		missing = If query result is missing text from 4th value
		#		empty = If the query results in no results
		#		not_empty = If the query is not empty
		#	4 = Text to match
	- The manifest contains all database updates 'Required' to be made to the schema, and it will contain a working backport all the way back to SVN -
		currently it is tested and backported through the beginning of our Github repo
	- On world bootup or standalone run of db_update.pl, users will be prompted with a simple menu that we will expand upon later:

Akkadius: World will now check the db_update.pl script on bootup, if the db_update.pl script is not present, it will fetch it remotely before running -
	when db_update.pl is done running, world will continue with bootup

== 11/15/2014 ==
Uleat(Natedog): A better fix for OP_ShopPlayerBuy - doesn't cause the issues that I introduced
Kayen: Implemented NPC Special Ability 41 'Allow To Tank', gives NPC opportunity to take aggro over a client in melee range.
Kayen: Updated swarm pet AI to be consistent with live.

*OLD AI: Swarm pet would lock on to target until target died, then depop as soon as target died.

*NEW AI: Swarm pet will attack cast on target, NOT perma locked it can change targets if attacked
by something else that generate more hate. When target dies swarm pet will follow owner, if owner is
attacked by something else the swarm pet will attack it (until duration timer despawns the pet).

Kayen: Updated perl quest function: MakeTempPet(Tspell_id, name=nullptr, duration=0, target=nullptr, sticktarg=0)
Kayen: Implemented perl quest function:  Mob::TypesTempPet(npctypesid, name=nullptr, duration=0, follow=0, target=nullptr, sticktarg=0)
Note: 'sticktarg' field will cause the swarm pet to use the OLD AI

Rule to use OLD AI only - default is disabled.

Uleat: Fix for GM Trainer crashing server (really!)
JJ: Yellow faction messages.

== 11/09/2014 ==

mackal: Tracking default sort will now be correct order
Trevius: Fixed dynamic merchant list loading.  Allows any merchant to be used in any zone.

== 11/03/2014 ==
Secrets: Fixed an overflow in melee lifetap calculations (int16 vs int32)
Secrets: Fixed overflow on AC and ATK values that can go out of range.
Secrets: Merc/Bot fixes for previous updates.
Secrets: Changed a lot of int16s for stat-related functions to int32 because they were causing combat formula overflows (int16/int32 mismatch).
Secrets: Linux fix?

== 11/02/2014 ==
Akkadius: Added out of range checking for Spell Save/Loads

== 11/01/2014 ==
Trevius: Fixed potential crash related to Pets/Mercs buffs when targeting themselves.
JJ: (noudess) Revamped faction system. See https://github.com/EQEmu/Server/pull/256

Uleat: Added Client::InterrogateInventory(). Can be invoked by #interrogateinv and is also called when Handle_OP_MoveItem() calls for SwapItemResync()

== 10/22/2014 ==
Uleat: Fix for stacking items in a world object..added a new command option: #peekinv world - will show world container contents, if one is in use by target.

== 10/20/2014 ==
mackal: Inspect Buffs rank 1 will now show NPC buffs in target window (SoD+)

== 10/19/2014 ==

mackal: Implement group mentor, sharing leadership exp (SoF+ only)
mackal: Add gaining of group leadership while in raids

== 10/16/2014 ==
Uleat: Fixed the auto-conversion view naming error and renamed the views in the script files. Added a fix sql for databases that auto-converted.
Fix SQL: ../sql/git/bots/deprecated/2014_10_16_Lower_Case_View_Fix.sql

== 10/15/2014 ==
Uleat: Cleaned up load/drop bots sqls, added '../utils/sql/git/bots/deprecated' and '../deprecated/load_bots_old.sql' (use this file on pre-player blob conversion databases.)
Notes: I modifed the behavior of both load and drop bots to fail on the first operation if their modifications have been performed already.
       'load_bots.sql' will explicitly add bot schema, while 'drop_bots.sql' will explicitly drop it. I also added a few lines to change
	   a few altered tables back to their original state - as of the date in the file.

== 10/13/2014 ==
mackal: Partially implement leadership and raids
	Currently working: client side only effects and stat bonuses.
	Not working: Mark NPC, and other stuff that need extra server side support
	Currently only UF tested (Tit and 62 may just work, others need packet work)

== 10/12/2014 ==
Akkadius: Fix for LDON Character Stat load

== 10/11/2014 ==
mackal: Implement Raid MOTD for UF
	Don't forget 2014_10_11_RaidMOTD.sql!

== 10/09/2014 ==
Uleat: Added 'BOTS' conversion code to supplement the database 'PlayerProfile' blob conversion that Akkadius recently implemented.
Note: This automatic conversion uses the view `vwbotcharactermobs` as an update vector. If you need/would like for the converter to run on
previously and/or manually changed code, or just have a need for it to re-run, change the following in the database view and save:
	"c.`last_login`,"				to	"c.`timelaston`,"
	"c.`zone_id`"					to	"c.`zoneid`"
	"FROM `character_data` AS c"	to	"FROM `character_old` AS c"
** This will only work if you haven't deleted your `character_old` table **

== 10/07/2014 ==
mackal: Identified tutorial flag in all charcreate packets, reworked logic to correctly set homes binds

== 10/05/2014 ==
Uleat: Added Server<->Corpse slot translators needed for re-enumeration (inactive until phased in)

== 10/03/2014 ==
Uleat: Fixed Ti(6.2) OP_AugmentInfo translation that I broke (does not currently need and I mis-read a process)
Uleat: Moved client patch OP_LootItem slot translation to external handlers

== 10/02/2014 ==
Kayen: Exported to PERL $client->SendSpellAnim(targetid, spellid)
This function sends the spell graphic of a spell without actually having to cast the spell.

== 10/02/2014 ==
Uleat: First round of Ti/6.2 translators added - needed for re-enumeration

== 10/01/2014 ==
Kayen: Exported to PERL $client->SendColoredText(color, msg)
mackal: Exported SendColoredText to lua

== 09/30/2014 ==
Uleat: Implemented click-casting from bag slots for clients that natively support it (RoF)

== 09/28/2014 ==
mackal: Add support for post June 18, 2014 Hundred Hands Effect spells (they changed the formula and stuff)
set Spells:Jun182014HundredHandsRevamp to true if you're using a spell file from June 18, 2014+

== 09/27/2014 ==
Kayen: Implemented perl function $mob->GetSpellStat(spell_id, identifier, slot);
Note: identifier is the stat field in spells_new, slot is used for certain effects like effectid, base,base2, max ect.
Example $mob->GetSpellStat(121, "range"); //Returns spell range
Example $mob->GetSpellStat(121, "effectid", 1); //Returns the the value of effectid1
This will allow you to pull almost all the data for any spell in quest files.
mackal: Move the client's SetAttackTimer to the end of Client::CalcBonuses to keep the haste in sync
mackal: Correct haste/slow "stacking" rules
mackal: Correct SE_AttackSpeed4 to respect unslowable
mackal: Make the haste be between 1-225 like the client (<100 = slow, >100 = haste) to ...
mackal: Correct Hundred Hands effect and use formula provided by devs

== 09/24/2014 ==
Uleat: Re-ordered server opcodes and handlers to give them some predictability of location (I need this for the inventory re-enumeration.)
mackal: Added helper function bool EQEmu::IsTradeskill(uint32 skill)

== 09/23/2014 ==
Kayen: Spell recourse effects will now be applied AFTER the base spells effects have been applied (consistent with live).
Kayen: SE_ApplySpell and SE_TriggerSpell will now be applied based on which effect slot they are used in (instead of always before all spell effects are checked).
Note: If a spell has multiple SE_TriggerSpell effects within it. Only one will be able to trigger. (If you want multiple spells use SE_ApplySpell)

== 09/22/2014 ==
Akkadius: #resetaa now covers the function of #resetaa and #refundaa
	- #resetaa will wipe all AA data, refund the spent points into the available points and send character to character select properly
Akkadius: Removed #refundaa
Akkadius: Removed a lot of debug code for blob conversion
Akkadius: Changed status logging for loads/saves to Debug category

== 09/21/2014 ==
Akkadius: Player Profile Blob to Database Conversion
	- Summary: HUGE difference in database speeds reads/writes and 1:10 datasize difference
		- The new character storage engine unlike the character_ table before, is able to properly index data and make use of
			proper MySQL/MariaDB caching optimizations and performance has increased phenominally
		PERFORMANCE AND STATISTICS FIGURES (Varies on hardware):
		- EZ Server Character data size of 2.6GB `character_` table alone now takes up approx 600MB
		- Character Data Loads take approx .03 seconds BEFORE MySQL/MariaDB cache
		- Character Data Loads take approx .001-.0035 seconds AFTER MySQL/MariaDB cache
		- Character Data Saves take approx .0001 - .003 for any particular save operation
		- Database Auto Conversion: When the 'character_' table exists, World boot-up will queue an auto-conversion prompt and convert all of your characters, BACKUP
			YOUR DATABASE BEFORE CONVERTING, here is an EASY backup script: http://wiki.eqemulator.org/p?MySQL_DB_Backup_Script
			- On auto conversion, the following tables are created automatically:
				- Table: `character_skills` - Stores Character Skills
				- Table: `character_languages` - Stores Character Language
				- Table: `character_bind` - Stores Character Bind point and Home Bind point designated by is_home bool field
				- Table: `character_alternate_abilities` - Stores all Character AA
				- Table: `character_currency` - Stores all Platinum/Gold/Silver/Copper and character related currencies
				- Table: `character_data` - Stores basic character data (Fields from `character_` table migrated to this table)
				- Table: `character_spells` - Stores character spells
				- Table: `character_memmed_spells` - Stores character memorized spells
				- Table: `character_disciplines` - Stores character disciplines
				- Table: `character_material` - Stores character armor dye textures
				- Table: `character_tribute` - Stores character tributes
				- Table: `character_bandolier` - Stores character bandoliers
				- Table: `character_inspect_messages` - Stores character inspection messages (Moved from `character_` table)
				- Table: `character_leadership_abilities` - Stores character Leadership AAs
	- Loads: Majority of Player profile loads now occur at Client::Handle_Connect_OP_ZoneEntry
		LoadCharacterFactionValues(uint32 character_id, faction_map & val_list);
		LoadCharacterSpellBook(uint32 character_id, PlayerProfile_Struct* pp);
		LoadCharacterMemmedSpells(uint32 character_id, PlayerProfile_Struct* pp);
		LoadCharacterLanguages(uint32 character_id, PlayerProfile_Struct* pp);
		LoadCharacterDisciplines(uint32 character_id, PlayerProfile_Struct* pp);
		LoadCharacterSkills(uint32 character_id, PlayerProfile_Struct* pp);
		LoadCharacterData(uint32 character_id, PlayerProfile_Struct* pp, ExtendedProfile_Struct* m_epp);
		LoadCharacterCurrency(uint32 character_id, PlayerProfile_Struct* pp);
		LoadCharacterBindPoint(uint32 character_id, PlayerProfile_Struct* pp);
		LoadCharacterMaterialColor(uint32 character_id, PlayerProfile_Struct* pp);
		LoadCharacterBandolier(uint32 character_id, PlayerProfile_Struct* pp);
		LoadCharacterTribute(uint32 character_id, PlayerProfile_Struct* pp);
		LoadCharacterPotions(uint32 character_id, PlayerProfile_Struct* pp);
		LoadCharacterLeadershipAA(uint32 character_id, PlayerProfile_Struct* pp);
	- Saves: Occur all over the code now instead of calling full saves
		SaveCharacterBindPoint(uint32 character_id, uint32 zone_id, uint32 instance_id, float x, float y, float z, float heading, uint8 is_home);
		SaveCharacterCurrency(uint32 character_id, PlayerProfile_Struct* pp);
		SaveCharacterData(uint32 character_id, uint32 account_id, PlayerProfile_Struct* pp, ExtendedProfile_Struct* m_epp);
		SaveCharacterAA(uint32 character_id, uint32 aa_id, uint32 current_level);
		SaveCharacterSpell(uint32 character_id, uint32 spell_id, uint32 slot_id);
		SaveCharacterMemorizedSpell(uint32 character_id, uint32 spell_id, uint32 slot_id);
		SaveCharacterMaterialColor(uint32 character_id, uint32 slot_id, uint32 color);
		SaveCharacterSkill(uint32 character_id, uint32 skill_id, uint32 value);
		SaveCharacterLanguage(uint32 character_id, uint32 lang_id, uint32 value);
		SaveCharacterDisc(uint32 character_id, uint32 slot_id, uint32 disc_id);
		SaveCharacterTribute(uint32 character_id, PlayerProfile_Struct* pp);
		SaveCharacterBandolier(uint32 character_id, uint8 bandolier_id, uint8 bandolier_slot, uint32 item_id, uint32 icon, const char* bandolier_name);
		SaveCharacterPotionBelt(uint32 character_id, uint8 potion_id, uint32 item_id, uint32 icon);
		SaveCharacterLeadershipAA(uint32 character_id, PlayerProfile_Struct* pp);
	- Deletes:
		DeleteCharacterSpell(uint32 character_id, uint32 spell_id, uint32 slot_id);
		DeleteCharacterMemorizedSpell(uint32 character_id, uint32 spell_id, uint32 slot_id);
		DeleteCharacterDisc(uint32 character_id, uint32 slot_id);
		DeleteCharacterBandolier(uint32 character_id, uint32 band_id);
		DeleteCharacterLeadershipAAs(uint32 character_id);
	- Now occur all over the code and only trigger when necessary
	- Two FULL saves when looting a corpse, this has been reduced to just currency saves on initial loot and trimmed to one save since AddToMoneyPP did it already
	- Every time a player moves coin with any situation (Splits/Trades/Merchant/Skills/Bank Coin Exchange/Coin Moves), a full save is made, this is now just a currency save
	- Every time a player skilled up at a skill vendor, a full blob save hit was made, this is not just a currency hit
	- Every time an AA was purchased, a full save was made
	- Every time a spell was scribed/swapped, disc was trained
	- When a client exists a zone, when a client enters a zone
	- NOTE: These amount of excessive saves have caused scalability issues that cause the `character_` table to hang which causes process hangs that affect the whole server
		because of the slowness of the `character_` table and the blob not allowing any indexing to occur
	- All functions that once depended on the `character_` table are now rewritten to appropriately read from the `character_data` table
	- Database query errors that occur during conversion or from and load/save/delete character functions are now leveraged via ThrowDBError and logs now go to
		Server_Folder_Root/eqemu_query_error_log.txt (You cannot log errors natively through MySQL)
	- DBASYNC IS NOW COMPLETELY REMOVED - This was mainly for Character data async loads/saves and merchantlist loads
	- Side implementations:
		Perl Exports:
			- quest::crosszonesetentityvariablebynpctypeid(npctype_id, id, m_var) - Sets entity variables world wide with specified npctype_id
			- quest::crosszonesignalnpcbynpctypeid(npctype_id, data) - Signals all NPC entities world wide with specified npctype_id
			- $client->GetTaskActivityDoneCount(TaskID, ActivityID) - Gets task activity done count by task id and activity id for client entity

	VIEW TABLE SIZE AFTER CONVERT:

	SELECT CONCAT(table_schema, '.', table_name) as table_name,
		   CONCAT(ROUND(table_rows / 1000000, 2), 'M')                                    rows,
		   CONCAT(ROUND(data_length / ( 1024 * 1024 * 1024 ), 2), 'G')                    DATA,
		   CONCAT(ROUND(index_length / ( 1024 * 1024 * 1024 ), 2), 'G')                   idx,
		   CONCAT(ROUND(( data_length + index_length ) / ( 1024 * 1024 * 1024 ), 2), 'G') total_size,
		   ROUND(index_length / data_length, 2)                                           idxfrac
	FROM   information_schema.TABLES
	WHERE `table_name` LIKE 'character_%'
	ORDER  BY DATA DESC;

mackal: Fix crash in SendEnterWorld on illegally long names
mackal: The client only lets you enter 15 characters for your name (UF at least)
mackal: Add rule Spells:SHDProcIDOffByOne for pre-UF spell file, set to true, UF+ set to false
KLS: #suspend and #ban now have required messages to record the reason for the ban/suspension.

mackal: Added Client::Tell_StringID (used in tell queue messages)
mackal: Tell queues (and offline) messages now show correctly
mackal: Fix starting with capital check

== 09/18/2014==
mackal: Implement tell queues
	Currently set to a limit of 20 by default (World:TellQueueSize) I was unable to hit the limit on live though (100+)
	The required SQL nukes the old tell queue table, which may or may not be in your DB
	Optional SQL adds the rule to the DB to allow easy of change
	Note: this does not play well with multiple sessions with the same name on (crash and relog and have multiple sessions) but normal tells don't play well either

Akkadius: Fixed ROF Augment item dupe with not checking for available slots properly and adding items to the virtual instance

== 09/06/2014 ==
Uleat: Tweaked 'Smart' trading code to return main slots before sub slots in stackable and free space search processes. (If enough people ask for it, I'll add an optional rule to allow 'bag packing' - the original implementation behavior)

== 09/05/2014 ==
Uleat: Fix for cursor item loss when zoning. (Thanks to the other devs who traced and fixed the 'macro' issue!)
mackal: Fix size getting nuked with lua's SendIllusionPacket

== 09/03/2014 ==
Secrets: Identified the routines needed to augment items in RoF. Currently, only Insert and Remove are supported. Swap and Destroy do not work due to missing functions related to the cursor.
mackal: Added work around command to show numhits on your buffs (#shownumhits)
Uleat: Fix for timer issue introduced by Zone::ShutDown() fix.

== 09/02/2014 ==
Secrets: Identified OP_GuildPromote for RoF clients.
Secrets: Fixed promotion, demotion, transferring a leader and displaying of client ranks in the Rain of Fear client. The rain of fear client, as such, will only have 3 ranks like the other clients, but supports a theoretical 8 ranks later.
Secrets/Akkadius: Fixed an issue involving character name lookup in the new DB code.
mackal: crash fix checking DivineAura in hate_list.cpp
Secrets: Reverted some code that got in the main branch that shouldn't have gotten there.

== 08/30/2014 ==
mackal: (noudess) Merchants should be more descriptive of why they don't sell to you

== 08/26/2014 ==
Uleat: Implemented 'Smart' Player Trade transfers. Trades are processed by containers, stackables and then all remaining. QueryServ logs have been updated to match these transactions.
Note: QueryServ logs previously listed 'Items' on the main entry table. This indicated the number of slots affected and not the actual number of items.
This field now indicates the actual number of items transferred. For non-stackable, the value is '1' and stackable is the number of charges. A _detail_count
property has been added to both 'Trade' and 'Handin' structs to indicate the number of details recorded..though, not tracked..it could be added.

== 08/24/2014 ==
Uleat: Fix (attempted) for zone crashes related to zone shut-down. This change disables all Mob AI and disables/deletes all Mob timers once Zone::ShutDown() is called. More areas will be addressed as reports come in.
Note: Perl and Lua quests tested to work..please post any aberrant behavior. (I finally set my spell-check to US English...)
Akkadius: Character creation process crash fix and query cleanup
Akkadius: Created `character_lookup` table for applications that mirrors all `character_` table fields minus blob fields for application lookups
	- A 2.4GB character_ table will take 7 seconds to query on a SSD versus .1s on the character_lookup table
	- This also causes applications like Magelo to burst reads of the entire character table because of the blob fields that come with the reads, as much as 500-600MB/s even if a indexed id filter is provided
	- This field is synchronized on player save and has 0.001s DB hit
	- When we split out from the blob, ideally this table can be removed
	- Required SQL: utils\sql\git\required\2014_08_24_character_lookup.sql

== 08/23/2014 ==
Akkadius: Changed zone process window title format, example: 'crushbone :: clients: 6 inst_id: 1 inst_ver: 0 :: port: 7015'
Akkadius: Most of the following changes are QueryServ related, fully implemented its original functionality to be able to offload
	intensive or metric based logging to a remote server process that could exist on another server entirely
Akkadius: Implemented Player Event Logging Types (Go to table `qs_player_events`):
			1 = Player_Log_Quest,
			2 = Player_Log_Zoning,
			3 = Player_Log_Deaths,
			4 = Player_Log_Connect_State,
			5 = Player_Log_Levels,
			6 = Player_Log_Keyring_Addition,
			7 = Player_Log_QGlobal_Update,
			8 = Player_Log_Task_Updates,
			9 = Player_Log_AA_Purchases,
			10 = Player_Log_Trade_Skill_Events,
			11 = Player_Log_Issued_Commands,
			12 = Player_Log_Money_Transactions,
			13 = Player_Log_Alternate_Currency_Transactions,
		- All QueryServ logging will be implemented with a front end in EoC 2.0 very soon
		- Architecture page: http://wiki.eqemulator.org/p?QueryServ_Architecture
Akkadius: Changed all QS Error related logging to 'QUERYSERV__ERROR'
Akkadius: (Natedog) (Crash Fix) Legacy MySQL bug revert for loading AA's COALESCE( from COALESCE (
Akkadius: Implemented Perl Quest objects (LUA still needed to be exported):
	- quest::qs_send_query("MySQL query") - Will send a raw query to the QueryServ process, useful for custom logging
	- quest::qs_player_event(char_id, event_desc); - Will process a quest type event to table `qs_player_events`
Akkadius: Added MySQL Tables
	- `qs_player_aa_rate_hourly`
	- `qs_player_events`
	- Source table structures from:
		- utils\sql\git\queryserv\required\08_23_2014_player_events_and_player_aa_rate_hourly
		To get the complete QueryServ schema, source from here:
		- utils\sql\git\queryserv\required\Complete_QueryServ_Table_Structures.sql
Akkadius: Added rules for each logging type, source rules here with them enabled by default:
	- utils\sql\git\queryserv\required\Complete_QueryServ_Rules_Enabled.sql
Akkadius: Spawn related logging cleanup
Akkadius: General code cleanup
Akkadius: More to come for QueryServ

== 08/22/2014 ==
Uleat: Rework of Trade::FinishedTrade() and Trade::ResetTrade() to parse items a little more intelligently.

Trade window items are now sent to client inventory in this order:
	- Bags
	- Partial stack movements
	- All remaining items

If any of these procedures cause any problems, please post them immediately.

== 08/20/2014 ==
Uleat: Rework of Trade::AddEntity() - function used to move items into the trade window. Now accepts argument for 'stack_size' and updates client properly.
Note: I tested trade with Titanium:{SoF,SoD,UF,RoF} in both directions and no client generated an OP_MoveItem event for attempting to place a stackable
onto a partial stack already in the trade window. The only way to achieve stacking is to click on the receiving client. If there is a partial stack remaining
on the cursor after the OP_MoveItem event, and there is room available, the client will generate subsequent events to move the remaining count.

== 08/19/2014 ==
Akkadius: Implemented a Stop_Return feature (Accidental item handin prevention) that will be symmetrically used with plugin::return_items that I am currently running live testing on EZ before releasing to EQEmu. This does not hurt to have this in the source.
Akkadius: Fixed crash where 'attacker' validation is not being checked
Akkadius: Removed petition console spam that does not follow traditional logging and is useless
Akkadius: Made fix with SympatheticProcChances where it was checking for TempItem->Focus.Effect instead of TempItemAug->Focus.Effect

Uleat: Fix for https://github.com/EQEmu/Server/issues/127 -- also activated a remarked action in doors.cpp to eliminate a memory leak.

== 08/16/2014 ==
KLS: (addmoreice) Trying out some unstable DB changes.  Do backup your database before trying them as master will be considered unstable for a few days at least.
Uleat (Noudness): Fixed a floating-point comparison error that led to the notorious 'client bounce' (this is not related to the
'mob falling' due to not having maps installed.) This fix also eliminates a sizeable amount of unnecessary out-going packets due
to invalid orientation corrections.
Note: This patch is probably of significant enough importance that admins may wish to manually apply this to older server builds.
The number of packets reduced per second should be approximately (num_stationary_close_clients * (num_close_clients - 1)). This will
likely have the most effect in zones like: Nexus, Bazaar, Guilds (Halls) and RAID INSTANCES - where players don't move around a lot.

== 08/15/2014 ==
Uleat: Reactivated the Bot::Spawn() code for sending post-spawn wear change updates..temporary until I can sort out the proper usage.

== 08/13/2014 ==
Uleat (Kingly_Krab): Fix for bot chest armor graphic glitch. (fix also caused RoF #wc to work properly)

== 08/02/2014 ==
Kayen: Implemented spell_news fields
- npc_no_los (check if LOS is required for spells)
- InCombat, OutofCombat - Used together to restrict spells to only be cast while
in/out of combat (beneficial) or if target is in/out of combat (detrimental).
-min_dist, min_dist_mod, max_dist, max_dist_mod - Scales spell power based on targets distance from caster.
*This will require further work to fully implement but will work with 90% of live spells as is.
*If making custom spells do not include effects that can't be scaled (like a spell trigger)
- min_rage sets minimum distance range that must be away from target.

== 07/31/2014 ==
Uleat: More inventory slot constant conversions. This should be the bulk of everything..but, due to the size of the server code, there
may be some hidden ones. (client_packet.cpp and the client translators still need a thorough review.)
Note: Please report any abnormal behaviour with inventory-related content..each diff file was reviewed 3 times..but, things CAN be missed.
Uleat: Test fix for client crashes in Bazaar, while actively selling, with a charm in the Trader's Satchel.

== 07/27/2014 ==
Uleat: More updates to the dictionary. Added a 'constants' file for each client translator..these will tie-in to the dictionary. Started
replacement of hard-coded numeric values with a pre-defined constant. This will help in the transition.

== 07/16/2014 ==
Uleat: Initial commit of new client/server 'dictionaries' - work in-progress... Changed equipment slot references to reflect new naming
conventions. Lua enumerations maintain both the old and new names as to not break existing scripts..but, the old names are deprecated.


== 07/14/2014 ==
KLS: Changes to CMake build
	-Lua builds by default now
	-Common has been renamed common
	-Binary files will now be put into ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin instead of ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/Bin
	The last two are of note to people on non-windows systems as case sensitivity is important.  Edit your scripts accordingly, thank you.


== 07/10/2014 ==
Kayen: Updated table npc_spells to now support defensive and ranged procs.
Note: Proc rate modifier work as it does for spell effects (ie 200 = 200% baseline chance modifier)
Table is also now contains 12 AI spell casting variables that can be set to fine tune casting behaviors per spell set.
Global default rules have also been added that can further fine tune all content if no specific variables are set.

== 06/8/2014 ==
KLS: Changed lua API: eq.get_globals(client, npc) has been removed.  Use eq.get_globals(npc, client) instead.
There's a bug with something in gcc 4.6.3 (maybe other versions) on x86 that this is attempting to combat.

Uleat: Oops! Wrong state check (conn_state != client_state)
Uleat: Test fix to eliminate seemingly random crashes when an AE spell is being used. (Possible access to uninstantiated pointers during client connection process when someone casts a beneficial AE spell within range of a connecting client.)

== 04/29/2014 ==
KLS: Implemented new map code based on some of Derision's earlier work.  Old maps still work with this system and don't need to be regenerated. We're still working on a new azone solution for better/more efficient maps.

== 04/27/2014 ==
Kayen: Implemented new table 'npc_spells_effects' and 'npc_spells_effects_entires'.
       Implemented new field in 'npc_spell_effects_id' in npc_types.


These are used to directly apply spell effect bonuses to NPC's without requirings spells/buffs.
Example: Allow an npc to spawn with an innate 50 pt damage shield and a 5% chance to critical hit.
Please see the wiki page: http://wiki.eqemulator.org/p?npc_spell_effects_entries for details.
*NPC's can now do critical heals / damage spells if bonus is applied from table.

KLS: Change to how quest signals work, signals with no delay will now be added to the signal queue.  This addresses an odd timing issue where NPCs are in a state of life/death flux when a signal from event_death goes off.
KLS: Added cmake flags to define how logging behavior works for each different log type.
Secrets: Crash fix for Hatelist crash observed

Kayen: Implemented ability to use the actual live spell projectile graphics that are defined in the modern spell file.
   *This is disabled by default. Recommend enabling if your server uses an UF+ spell file AND most of your players use UF+ clients.
Kayen: Expanded the PERL ProjectileAnim(mob, item_id, [IsArrow?, speed, angle, tilt, arc, IDFile]) so you can now just set the weapon model graphic IT####
Example: ProjectileAnim($npc, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, "IT10747")  This will shoot an SK 2.0 sword.
Kayen: Updated wizard innate critical damage modifier to be from 20-70% of base damage (based on live parses)

Akkadius: Fix for the Fix for the Fix: Rule Combat:OneProcPerWeapon was created so that you can revert to the original proc functionality
	for custom servers that have balanced their content around having more than 1 aug proc on weapons. By having this rule set to 'false' you revert this functionality.
	This rule is set to 'true' by default as the original functionality from Live was intended to be
Akkadius: (Performance Adjustment) Removed AsyncLoadVariables from InterserverTimer.Check() in both zone and world. By watching the MySQL general.log file on mass zone idle activity, you can
	see that the query 'SELECT varname, value, unix_timestamp() FROM variables where unix_timestamp(ts) >= timestamp' is called every 10 seconds. This function is loading
	variables that are initially loaded on World and Zone bootup. When running a large amount of zone servers, the amount of MySQL chatter that is produced is enormous and
	unnecessary. For example, if I ran 400 zone servers, I would see 3,456,000 unnecessary queries from all idle or active zone processes in a 24 hour interval.
Secrets: Added a rule to enable multiple procs from the same weapon's other slots if a proc is deemed to trigger, Defaults to true.
	If Combat:OneProcPerWeapon is not enabled, we reset the try for that weapon regardless of if we procced or not.
	This is for some servers that may want to have as many procs triggering from weapons as possible in a single round.

Secrets (Akkadius): Perl $client->SilentMessage("Message"); addition, this is a pre-req for a Perl plugin I've shared with EQEmu. This function essentially mimics a player speaking with an NPC - which is used in popup window responses
Secrets: Added functionality to Perl for $client->PlayMP3("name of file").
  Usage varies, but typically you can place an MP3/WAV/XMI in the EQDir//sounds, pfs, s3d, or root client folder and it will play through this Perl function. Example, $client->PlayMP3("combattheme1.mp3") or $client->PlayMP3("TUTBTrade1.mp3")
  All clients except Secrets of Faydwer and 6.2 have their opcodes identified for this function. The struct + supported params is the same throughout versions.
  Use $client->PlayMP3 with an invalid sound file to stop playback or simply wait for it to end.
KLS: Added functionality to Lua for Client:PlayMP3(filename)

== 11/23/2013 ==
Secrets: Fixed an issue related to a zone crash where the count of the abilities in an AA was 0, leading to a size 0 buffer issue.

== 11/19/2013 ==

== 10/28/2013 ==
Uleat: Client patch prep work for extending usable skill range (no apparent issues with Ti through RoF[12-10-2012] testing - i.e., clients showed proper skills and they didn't crash)
Uleat: This final patch aligns the existing server PlayerProfile_Struct with the previous changes. The pp_struct, as well as the character 'pp' blob, remains unchanged in size and alignment. The only difference is that the first trailing 100 bytes of the unknown array have been re-assigned to the skills array, and the unknown array decreased by the same amount.
Notes:
	- The existing configuration will allow the use of any new skills up to 99
	- Due to this new segment of the blob having never been written to properly, we may have erratic data there that needs to be cleared before use
	- None of the new skills are coded to use these 'new' skill slots
	- A per-client method will still need to be observed when coding for the new skill uses

== 10/27/2013 ==
Uleat: Attempted fix for high level (12) debug compile failures
Notes:
	- Explicit Windows vs. Linux code was not changed due to my inability to compile Linux code
	- Only CMake accessible flags were corrected if adding the 'std' namespace did not correct the issue
	- the tag [CODEBUG] was added to failed code identifed by the above note
	- If you are having compile issues after this patch is committed, look to the changes here first
Uleat: Changed riposte fail check to proper failure criteria - (x == a && x == b, where a != b) never passes, so skills a and b can riposte (discovery find, no known reported occurences)
Uleat: Enforced naming standard on my recent changes (Sorry for any inconviencies)
Uleat: Moved DeityTypes enumeration from eq_constants.h to deity.h (expanded utility of accessors, but are yet to be implemented)
Uleat: Changed ItemUseType to ItemInstTypes to better reflect the definition (also to free-up the namespace)
Uleat: Changed ItemClass to ItemClassTypes
Uleat: Converted MATERIAL defines to MaterialUseSlots enumeration - use of scripted 'Bracer' and 'Max' are deprecated
Uleat: Changed ItemTypes to ItemUseTypes - retained the 'ItemType' prefix to avoid too much confusion. Also adopted the '1H Piercing' model found in later clients
Uleat: Converted SkillType typedef enumeration to SkillUseTypes enumeration - Some prep work for adding the newer skills
Uleat: Prepped the client patch files for larger skill buffer size (not active)

Uleat: Expanded the 'Bag Type' enumeration to include all known values. Also, set in place additional 'Bag Type' to 'Skill Type' conversions. Some of these will need to be verified before activation.
Uleat: Cleaned up some unused enumerations to show a move towards standardization. More to come...

== 10/12/2013 ==
mackal: Allow Titanium and lower clients to enter Tutorial zone from character select
Bad_Captain: Fixed merc crash issue by updating special_abilities & vwMercNpcTypes (Sorvani).

JJ: (mackal) Allow use of Go Home button when Tutorial still selected in RoF.

== 10/10/2013 ==
Secrets: Fixed zone shutdown (or #reloadqst) reinitalization of Perl. This should allow for Perl 5.14 and later to work on Windows under the new quest system.
mackal: Beneficial single target buffs shouldn't have their mana/timers set if they fail to cast after the Mob::SpellOnTarget call in Mob::SpellFinished
JJ: Revert change to EnterWorldPacket introduced on 22 April 2013 to fix inability to enter Tutorial or Go Home from character select screen.

== 10/09/2013 ==
mackal: Fixed some more instances of the AA timer being eaten

== 10/08/2013 ==
mackal: Added IsBuffSpell(spell_id) that will return true if the spell has a duration, so would end up in effects/song/discs etc windows on the client
mackal: Replaced instances of using CalcBuffDuration to determine if a spell was a buff with IsBuffSpell
mackal: Removed Mob::HasBuffIcon since it was doing what IsBuffSpell does in a more convoluted way with a rather misleading name
mackal: Fixed issues that arose from the 10/03/2013 change

== 10/05/2013 ==
Sorvani: fixed issue with stackable items being created with 0 charges cause by fix to SummonItems

KLS: Fix for reported issue on forums with skills that could potentially be trained before a player achieved the level to train.

== 08/20/2013 ==
Uleat: Fix for bot pet spell buff corruption (existing db issues will correct themselves through pet death attrition)

== 07/18/2013 ==

== 07/15/2013 ==
Sorvani: fix for lua_general.cpp funtion get_spawn_condition
Uleat: added non-extensioned wildcard filter to \\...\dependencies\.gitignore to fix tortoisegit inclusion errors (fixes commit and display overlay issues.)

== 07/13/2013 ==
KLS: Added packet class and helper functions to Lua.
KLS: Added quest event: event_unhandled_opcode

== 07/11/2013 ==
KLS: Added a few lua functions.
KLS: Redid the npcspecialatk system with a new system that is more flexible but a little more complicated (this will break any 3rd party tools that deal with them).

Instead of a string such as "ERS" to denote "Enrage Rampage Summon" abilities are indexed by their ability number, level and params separated by '^'.
It is stored in the following format: ability,level[,param0,param1,param2,param3,param4,param5,param6,param7] Params will be read until there are 8 total or a '^' is reached.
Eg: 'ERS' -> '2,1^3,1^1,1

Levels allow us to dictate how abilities behave that may be different even though they're the same ability.
Params allow us to further refine behaviors on a case by case basis.  Passing 0 as a param will use the default value.

NOTE: Be sure to source 2013_07_11_NPC_Special_Abilities.sql.  Also due to the large impact this has on a database it is very HIGHLY SUGGESTED to BACKUP YOUR DATABASE FIRST.

Void SetSpecialAbilityParam(Integer ability, Integer param, Integer value);
Void ClearSpecialAbilities();
Void ProcessSpecialAbilities(String str);

The old API functions that worked with letters still exist for backwards compatibility reasons but wont be updated further.

== 07/08/2013 ==
Secrets: Cleanup of some log functions that did not have an 'off' function.**
Secrets: Unknown opcode messages only show on EQDEBUG* >= 5 or higher now. (including the dumped packet)

*NOTE: We recommend for debugging and feature development that you keep EQDEBUG to 5 or higher. For production environments, we recommend 1 to help with CPU performance on windows machines and disk I/O on all platforms.
**Affected filters:
NET__ERROR
NET__DEBUG

== 07/05/2013 ==
KLS: Added some lua functions
KLS: Fixed some lua functions
KLS: Perl now will (like lua) keep track of the values you return from EVENT_*.  This allows perl to use the extra behavior in things like EVENT_DEATH.  Now generally the perl system is now considered deprecated (in favor of lua in the long term) I felt this was too big a change to pass up adding when I got it working.

== 07/02/2013 ==
KLS: Exported eq.follow(entity_id, [distance]) and eq.stop_follow() to lua.

== 07/01/2013 ==
mackal: Fix Monster Summoning related to giants/cyclops
mackal: Prevent Monster Summoning from summoning a portal in bothunder
KLS: Merge of lua branch to master
See: http://www.eqemulator.org/forums/showthread.php?t=37008 for more detailed information on what is added.
Upgrade notes:
	-'templates' quest folder needs to be renamed 'global'
	-'items' quest folder needs to be moved into the 'global' folder
	-'spells' quest folder needs to be moved into the 'global' folder
	-EVENT_PROXIMITY_SAY needs to be enabled via quest before it will work, calling quest::enable_proximity_say() in EVENT_SPAWN will suffice.
	-quest::handleturnin, quest::completehandin, quest::resethandin, and quest::clearhandin have been removed. Take a look at https://code.google.com/p/projecteqquests/source/browse/trunk/quests/plugins/check_handin.pl plugin::mq_process_items, plugin::check_mq_handin, plugin::clear_mq_handin for MQ viable replacements.
	-Some spell quests that overwrote the effects from the spell they were cast on no longer function properly on perl, it's suggested you make the spells empty or rewrite the broken quests in lua and return a non-zero value.
	-Some item quests have changed in a subtle way, though it's unlikely any quests are impacted and the thread has more information if you found any of your quests broke.  As far as I know for example: PEQ didn't have to update any of its nearly 70 item quests.
	-Cazic Touch (982) no longer shouts the name of the thing it is targeting without a script.
	-EVENT_DEATH now triggers before the death is complete.  For the old functionality you may use EVENT_DEATH_COMPLETE.  It might be a good idea to replace all EVENT_DEATH with EVENT_DEATH_COMPLETE in existing spells.

We sought to minimize changes required but it's still a bit disruptive so take a few minutes when upgrading to make sure everything is correct.  Most notably quest::clearhandin was used in some popular plugins to avoid a dupe involved with its code and now that it's gone those will not function if fixes are not applied.

== 06/16/2013 ==
Secrets: Fixed an issue with RoF items and Req/Rec level above 100 appearing yellow. Recommended to enable the #iteminfo command for items that have a req/rec above 100 to display proper information regarding the info.

== 06/15/2013 ==
KLS: (image) Potentially could bypass some spell checks by passing a specially crafted spell slot.  This has been addressed.

	-More work on custom mod stuff (including examples)
	-Fix for login not bailing out if it cant connect to a db
	-Quite a few warning changes.

== 05/09/2013 ==

Tabasco: Added EVENT_ITEM_TICK for interactive item quest scripts.  (See https://github.com/josheb/quests_dc/blob/master/items/12204.pl)
	Added simple account flags.  Would this work better as an additional qglobal category?
	Added SendMessage to EQW, useful for using CURL to broadcast to the server.
	Added WorldShutDown to EQW for timed world shutdowns, also updated console worldshutdown command to optionally use timed behavior.

REQUIRED SQL: 2013_03_1_Merc_Rules_and_Equipment.sql

== 02/27/2013 ==
KLS: Changed how shared memory works:
    Instead of System V/windows pagefile shared memory we now have shared memory that's backed by the filesystem.
    What that means is basically instead of EMuSharedMem(shared library) we now have shared_memory(executable), shared memory will be persistent between runs until you delete or reload it using the shared_memory executable.

    STEPS FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO FIGURE IT OUT:
        1) Create a directory in the place you run world/zone named shared and make sure files can write there.
        2) Run the shared_memory executable from the same place you run world/zone (it's basically doing the loading we would do on startup so will take a moment).

Uleat: Fixed a corpse looting issue where the power source item (slot 9999) was being omitted from the corpse inventory. A previous oversight on my part. Also refined message reporting. (RoF: increased corpse slot limit to 34)
Uleat: Power Source items will now report in 'worn' instead of 'inv' when using #peekinv.

== 01/20/2013 ==
KLS: intN types have changed to more closely reflect C99 and C++11 types:
intN was an unsigned int of N bits -> it is now a signed int of N bits.
sintN was a signed int of N bits -> it has been removed in favor of intN.
uintN is still unsigned.
The existing types in the code have been changed automatically(intN -> uintN, sintN -> intN), but keep this in mind when developing in the future.

Derision: RoF: Guild name now appears in the Guild Management window and over player's heads. /guildstatus now works. Guild members status now updates in the GMW.
Uleat: Corrected the BulkSendInventory process for incomplete item trade returns resulting from a server crash. Previous code used an external reference and items were never moved..and hence, lost once a new trade occurred.
Uleat: Added mlog messages to existing BulkSendInventory code to report hidden item movements and deletions. All BSI and helper processes now log movements/deletions.
Uleat: Added two new client pre-entry inventory validation methods - RemoveDuplicateLore and MoveSlotNotAllowed. Duplicate lore was not checked and IsSlotAllowed failures were not handled. Both were causes of persistent desyncs.
Uleat: Corrected a bug in ItemInst::IsSlotAllowed that 'passed' PowerSource slot checks regardless of ItemInst::Slots value.
Uleat: [Client-Server Inventory Desyncronization] Most CSD bugs should now be corrected, or at least, compensated for. Please post any desync issues as a new bug post or pm a Dev or GM if it involves an exploit.

Sorvani: (Hateborne) copy paste issue in Mob::TryDivineSave corrected
Trevius: RoF - Fixed the Character Select Struct, which should prevent an error when trying to enter world on certain characters.
Trevius: RoF - Character Creation is now functional.
Trevius: RoF - Identified more fields in the Player Profile and added the correct checksum so the current packet should work (thanks Derision).
Trevius: RoF - Added the opcode for max characters to allow up to 10 chars to be created per account instead of 0 (thanks Noport).
Trevius: RoF - Fixed Drakkin Appearances at Character Select.  Appears that all facial/body features are now perfectly aligned.
Uleat: QueryServ player trade log code is now enabled. Set the rules_value to true to enable logging.

Trevius: RoF - More work on RoF Structs and added the Client Version stuff.
Trevius: RoF - Removed/Disabled most opcodes until we are further along and then I will add them all back in and populate the rest.
Trevius: RoF - Added a new packet dealing with membership status, but it may need more work.
Uleat: Added inspect message functionality for SoF+ clients.

Sorvani: (Uleat) Player Inspect works for Titanium users again. Spell casting from a clicky effect checks that the item is still in the slot it was cast from before applying the affect and removing the charge (if applicable).

==12/08/2012==
Secrets/Akkadius: Implemented the customary ability to scale an NPC's spell damage or healing % by a modifier loaded from the npc data in npc_types
	This will allow an NPC to do for example 150% of the damage of their damage spells if spellscale is set to '150'
	'healscale' field needs to be set to affect heals in a similar manner
	Both of these can also be accessed via ModifyNPCStat through 'healscale' and 'spellscale'

Secrets: Pets can no longer proc from any hand other than their primary hand. This fixes an issue where beastlord pets could proc two, three or four from dual wielding/double attacking pets (as well as a general mechanics fix).
Secrets: NPCs will no longer attempt to heal through walls. There is now a LOS check for friendly NPC heals through walls. This was especially apparent in the PEQ database in Splitpaw, where you could have maybe 10 NPCs healing through walls at a time. I don't recall this ever happening on live past OoW. If this is incorrect revert it and make it a rule.

==12/1/2012==
Vaion: Swarm Pets are now untargetable.  They still gain aggro, are attackable and can be casted on by NPCs, but clients cannot target them.
Sorvani: Items with 0 charges will no longer get a free recharge when players die. Changed the TargetName property for all projects to be $(ProjectName). The only project that will have a new name is chatserver. It is now called ucs matching the linux build.

==11/27/2012==
Sorvani: fix for newly created items with unlmiited charges to actually be usable.
Sorvani: (Uleat) Lore check is now made for items inside bags being trade before the trade completes.
Akkadius: Started first works of implementing QueryServ for what it was meant to be used
Akkadius: Moved QueryServ to it's own configuration block in the eqemu_config.xml (example):
	<qsdatabase>
		<host>localhost</host>
		<port>3306</port>
		<username>root</username>
		<password>password</password>
		<db>queryserv</db>
	</qsdatabase>
Akkadius: QueryServ can now be used on a separate server and can use an entirely separate database as it was meant to
Akkadius: Added 'loottable_id` to NPC::ModifyNPCStat which also changes quest::ModifyNPCStat(identifier, newValue); as well
Akkadius: Fixed heap corruption in quest_globals that would occur if a value over 64 bytes was created
Akkadius: Changed value size in qglobals from 64 bytes to 128 bytes
Akkadius: Added #reloadworld - This command will reload every single zones Perl quests and repop them
Secrets: Minor code fix for qglobals. Since we removed the id field from qglobals, I suppose we shouldn't use it in code.
Secrets: Warning fix for a quest function.
Secrets: Fixed a crash issue where player corpses did not exist at all in a function (ie; they were disabled) yet we are trying to use an invalid pointer
Secrets: durp, i'm retarded. memleak fix.

Perl Changes:
Akkadius: Added EVENT_DISCONNECT to global_player.pl/player.pl - Event that triggers whenever a character disconnects from the world
Akkadius: Added EVENT_CONNECT to global_player.pl/player.pl - Event that triggers whenever a character connects to the world
Akkadius: Added EVENT_TASK_UPDATE to global_player.pl/player.pl - Event that triggers whenever a donecount is incremented in a task, exports variables: $donecount, $activity_id and $task_id
Akkadius: Added EVENT_TASK_COMPLETE to global_player.pl/player.pl - Event that triggers whenever a task is complete, this can sort of be checked in EVENT_TASK_STAGE_COMPLETED already but this is more finite, exports variables: $donecount, $activity_id and $task_id
Akkadius: Added EVENT_TASK_FAIL to global_player.pl/player.pl - Event that triggers whenever a task has failed, exports variables: $task_id
Akkadius: Added $client->SignalClient($data), it uses the client as the initiator and the client that gets sent the data, good for entity_list iterations through client
Akkadius: Exported $client->AddAlternateCurrencyValue(currency_id, amount); originally created by KLS
Akkadius: Added quest::gettaskactivitydonecount(task, activity); which obviously will get the amount done in a task based on task and activity
Akkadius: Added cross zone client signalling capability by character ID: quest::crosszonesignalclientbycharid(char_id, data);
Akkadius: Added cross zone client signalling capability by character Name: quest::crosszonesignalclientbyname(Name, data);
Akkadius: Added cross zone client messaging capability by character Name: quest::crosszonemessageplayerbyname(Type, Name, Message);
Akkadius: Added the ability to flow #commands through Perl, by flow meaning if the command doesn't process through the traditional command system, it will dump the output to EVENT_SAY in player.pl/global_player.pl based on rule Chat:FlowCommandstoPerl_EVENT_SAY

QueryServ Changes:
* I plan on adding much more logging to this server, but for now I've started with the following:
* QueryServ requires rules to be enabled before packets get sent to QueryServ, otherwise World/Zone doesn't need to even craft the packets for logging
Akkadius: Logging all player kills through QueryServ, you need to have QueryServ:PlayerLogNPCKills Rule Enabled, type: 0 = Solo, 1 = Group, 2 = Raid
Akkadius: Player trades logging started but definitely not finished
Akkadius: Removed the rules system from QueryServ, rules should only be read from World/Zone

REQUIRED SQL: utils/sql/queryserv/2268_QueryServ.sql

Database Changes:
Akkadius: Added a field in `character_` called `firstlogon` that will essentially be booled true when a player logs on, it handles a characters online status between world and zone and ultimately gets used in EVENT_CONNECT
Akkadius: Completely dropped the `id` column in `quest_globals`, the (`charid`, `npcid`, `zoneid`, `name`) fields will act as the primary keys, tested and working fine. This solves capping out on ID's as they are unecessary.
Akkadius: Changed value size of `quest_globals` field `value` from 64 bytes to 128 bytes
Akkadius: Removed an AA that was causing heap corruption

cavedude: (Tabasco) Re-added probability, setting it to 100 (default) effectively bypasses probability and no additional roll is made. Setting it to 0 prevents the table from being rolled at all, so you can disable the table but still keep the entries if needed.
Required SQL: utils/sql/svn/2260_probability.sql

Sorvani: Tabasco sent in this bugfix: Ranged attack crash
It doesn't happen every time, but if an NPC is flagged for ranged attacks and they kill their target, the AIProcess function continues on under the assumption that the target is still available.

I just adjusted it to set a flag and do the actual attack at the end of the function. I haven't been able to reproduce the crash since.

==10/31/2012==
Akkadius: Added the ability to govern player max levels through the source per character. It will look for a qglobal named 'CharMaxLevel', type 5 qglobal, if the rule is enabled and the character flag is set, they will not be able to pass that level.

Kayen: Implemented SE_IncreaseNumHits - Focus that can inceases max number of hits a buff can have before being removed.
Kayen: Removed SE_Twinproc - This is not an actual spell effect, Twin proc is now correctly implemented as on live using SE_Twincast.
Kayen: Implemented SE_TwoHandBluntBlock - Chance to block when using two hand blunt weapon (similiar to shield block).
Kayen: SE_NegateEffect will now negate all AA, item and spell bonuses for the specified effects.
Kayen: Added support to allow for certain bonuses to now properly be calculated when cast as debuffs (ie decrease chance to critical hit)
Kayen: Implemented rule to allow certain bonuses to be calculated by adding together the value from each item, instead of taking the highest value.
  *Ie. Add together all worn cleave effects, ferocity effects ect.

OPTIONAL SQL: utils/sql/svn/2209_optional_additive_bonus_rule.sql (disabled by default)

==09/13/2012==
cavedude: Uleat implemented the following changes:

The bandolier function should no longer CAUSE desyncs. Its use can still be affected by previous issues, just like any manual swap. Message cues have been temporarily added to certain procedures to indicate to the player that a possible desync condition exists and that they should zone or relog to correct the situation immediately.

The chance of player corpses becoming bugged should now be minimal. Corpse processing was changed to better emulate client behavior when 'RespawnFromHover' is set to true or false. Message cues and #commands were added to help determine whether a corpse is bugged. (Previously, queued cursor items were sent to the corpse..but, the packet builder did not include the 8000-series of items when a player looted their corpse.)

Tweaked several areas where item swaps were not handled properly, or at all, and the client-server inventories became desyncronized. Additional areas are still suspect for causing desync's. (A 'ResyncInventory' method is in-work to eliminate the need for item deletion...)

Client::SummonItem now limits the size of a summoned stack to the value of stacksize in the database. If you are using script to summon stacks greater than item->stacksize, this action was/is incorrect and you will need to modify your 'quest' to summon multiple stacks.


command changes:
	#equipitem - modified partial stack movements..if a partial stack would be left on cursor, the action now fails.
	#corpse - added subcommand 'InspectLoot'..works for client and npc corpses..additional information with client.
	#peekinv - added stack size(charges) to report and modified the cursor depth reporting of bag slots.
	#zopp - new command for troubleshooting..forces a client 'trade' or 'summon' to desync the client inventory.

Kayen: Complete revision of the Death Save and Divine Save effects and related bonuses to be consistent with live.
  *Death Save (Death Pact/DI) will no longer fire on death. It should only fire when less 15% HP but not killed.
  *Death Save chance is determined soley by charisma of client with the buff. (RULE: DeathSaveCharismaMod)
  *Divine Intervention baseline is now correctly set to 8000HP (from 50k) (RULE: DivineInterventionHeal)
  *AA Touch of the Divine provides upon failure of first Death Save, a second roll and if successful will
   do a portion of the original heal value. (Ie DI=8000HP with ToTD-3(60%) your heal will be 8000*0.6 = 4800HP)
  *Implemented functionality for later expansion Death Save effects (Divine Intercession ect)
   These can add heal value to the base heal which is limited by level (ie Heal 10,0000+8000 if client less then level 80)

  *Divine Save (AA Unfailing Divinity) only fire upon death of client with this effect and is independent of Death Save effect.
  *Increased ranks of AA only increase the chance of firing upon death. Heal value does NOT increase with rank.
  *Upon firing you will still recieve the Divine Aura like buff, which now also correctly removes all determental effects.
Kayen: Implemented: SE_Purify - Removes determental buffs. Value determines how many buffs are removed.
Kayen: Added RULE MaxCastTimeReduction - Max percent your spell cast time can be reduced by spell haste(is/was 50%).

CLR  AA: Touch of the Divine now implemented with bonus SE_DivineSave.
DRU  AA: Enchanted root/Viscid Root (was implemented completely wrong), now uses bonus SE_RootBreakChance.
  *If a root is cast on the target and target has this AA it will decrease the chance for that root to break
   from any damage spells. The damage spells can be cast by any one, not just the client with the bonus.
   Added RULE: RootBreakFromSpells - Baseline is/was set at 20% chance from nukes.

Kayen: Updates to critical hit calcuations to be consistent with live.
  *Baseline critical rate is determined by DEX stat (255 dex = 2%),this baseline is then modified by item,spell and AA critical chance bonuses.
  *Pet critical baseline is determined by the rate from AA effects that give pets the ability to critical. (Can not crit w/o this effect)
Kayen: Slay Undead effect will now be working consistent with live.
  *Slay rate is no longer effected by critical hit rate, it uses it's own predetermined rates from the spell effect data.
  *Damage modification will now be much closer to that of lives utilizing the spell effects damage modifier.
  *Example(AA Slay Undead I - Rate: 225 (2.25%) Damage Mod: 680%)
  *Note that that spell effects using Slay Undead (Holyforge) will stack with AA and increase the damage and the rate.
Kayen: Crippling Blow's derived from spell effects will now be calculated consistent with live.
  *Cippling blow chance is determined by modifying your critical hit chance.
  *Example (Savage Onslaught - 200% chance to crippling blow) If you have a base chance to critical hit of 10%
   and you score a critical hit, you will then have a 20% chance to crippling blow.
Kayen: Fixed effect for AA 'War Cry' will now provide group fear immunity for duration.
Kayen: Few new AA's added including shaman Ancestral Aid and Spirit Channeling.

Kayen: Alternate Advancement Update: In the process of coverting most of the hard coded AA data out of the source and into the 'aa_effects' table
using live data. These effects are then reimplemented using the bonus system in the broadest possible way, most of these effects will
also be useable as regular spell/item effects. This will allow developers in the future to adjust,implement and customize AA effects
without requiring source changes. Beware in doing this, many AA effects that were previously either implemented incorrectly or with values
not consistent with live data will be adjusted to be as accurate as possible.

Following AA effects are now implemented as bonuses: You must update your 'aa_effects' table with 'required_aa_updates.sql' for these to work.
MISC AA: All innate run speed AA's have been converted to use bonus SE_BaseMovementSpeed.
MISC AA: All bind wound related AA have been converted to use bonuses, SE_ImprovedBindWound, SE_MaxBindWound.

MISC AA: Ferocity, Knight's Advantage ect - will now be calculated from bonus SE_DoubleAttackChance.
MISC AA: Harmonious Attacks, Bestial Frenzy - will allow double attack chance using bonus SE_GiveDoubleAttack (any class can be given this)
MISC AA: Weapon Affinity, will now use SE_ProcChance.
MISC AA: PunishingBlade, SpeedoftheKnight will now allow an extra 2 Handed attack using bonus, SE_ExtraAttackChance.
BRD  AA: Fleet of Foot will now correctly allow bards to run over the speed cap using, SE_IncreaseRunSpeedCap.
WAR  AA: Previously non functional 'Stalwart Endurance' and 'Dauntless Preservence' now working using bonus, SE_FrontalStunResist
MNK  AA: HightenedAwareness - Implemented using bonus, SE_BlockBehind.
MNK  AA: Technique of Master Wu - Will now correclty use a random monk special attack, chance for double/triple attack as SE_DoubleSpecialAttack.
MNK  AA: Dragon Punch - Implemented as now using bonus SE_SpecialAttackKBProc, (base1 = 100 [25% proc chance at 100] base2 = skill)
RNG  AA: Endless Quiver - Implemented as SE_ConsumeProjectile which gives a percent chance NOT to consume an arrow. (EQ base1 = 100)
RNG  AA: Archery Mastery- Implemented as SE_ArcheryDamageModifier which gives a percent increase to archery attacks.
BER  AA: Throwing Mastery - Implemented using SE_DamageModifier.
BER  AA: Blur of Axes, Vicious Frenzy - will now correctly add skill damage to 'Frenzy' skill attacks.

		*It is not meant to block buffs, rather it negates the specific spell bonuses or effects from buffs you already have.
		*Currently functional with any effect that is handled under bonuses, and focus effects.
Kayen: Vastly improved how we handle melee/spell runes/partial mitigation runes ect. Should be significantly more efficient.
		*Melee/Spell Mitigation runes and ManaAbsorbPercentDamage effects will now use the best mitigation value if multiple effects.
Kayen: Improved the process we use to get spell/item focus effects. An initial check if the client has a specific focusType
is done while checking for item/spell bonuses. GetFocusEffect will no longer check all inventory and buff slots every cast for the
focusType if that focusType doesn't exist on the client. This should improve performance since these checks are done 10-20x per cast/proc.

==07/15/2012==
Secrets: Fixed an issue with saylinks above 255 characters. If you do want to use saylinks above 255 characters, it is reccomended you adjust the varchar field in the saylinks table to a "TEXT" field, which supports up to 65535 characters.

Kayen: Implemented Perl NPC Quest Object GetSlowMitigation()
Kayen: Implemented Perl NPC Quest Object GetAttackSpeed()
Kayen: Implemented Perl NPC Quest Object GetAccuracyRating()
Kayen: Fixed: Slow Mitigation (was not loading from dbase),optimized its application in source and added lives slow mitigation messages.
		Slow mitigation Messages: 'slighty' 0.00 - 0.25 'partial' 0.25-0.75 'mostly' 0.75-1
Kayen: Implemented: SE_AttackSpeed4: 'Inhibit Melee' effect works different then regular haste/slow effect
		1) If target is hasted (or no haste) Inhibit Melee will decrease attack speed by the Inhibit Melee value.
		2) If target is slowed Inhibit Melee is applied as a percent change to remaining attack speed after regular slow.
		ie. You cast 75% Slow (25 attack speed remains) then apply 25% Inhibit melee (18.75 attack speed remains): Final slow 81.75%
Kayen: Added Rule: Spells:CharismaEffectiveness (Default = 10) Deterimes how much resist modification charisma applies to charm/pacify checks (10 CHA = -1 resist mod).
Kayen: Added Rule: Spells:CharmBreakCheckChance (Default = 25) Determines percent chance for a charm break check to occur each buff tick.
Kayen: Reworked code to that handles charm breaks/lull to be accurate to live and more functional in general.
		1) Each charm buff tick there is a default 25% [Rule.CharmBreakCheckChance] chance to trigger a spell resistance check.
		2) Spell resistance check then adds an additional bonus resist modification based casters Charisma at a default
		   ratio of 10 CHA per -1 resist mod [Rule.CharismaEffectiveness]
		3) If resisted (ie Charm is to break) Total Domination AA is then applied to give another chance to maintain the charm.

Kayen: Added Rule: ResistFalloff (Default = 67) Max that level that will adjust our resist chance based on level modifiers
Kayen: Adjusted Mob::TrySpellOnKill()
		- Will now check AA, Items and Buffs for SE_SpellOnKill (Same logic problem as TrySpellOnDeath)
		- Level of the npc you killed and the spell_id used to kill it now both passed into the function.
		- SE_TrySpellOnKill will now correctly check if there is a min level of the npc required for the spell effect to work (max value in spelldat)
Kayen: Implemented: SE_SpellOnKill2: For deterimental spells where landing the kill gives x% chance to give a buff.
Kayen: Sympathetic proc now calculates chance to proc a sympathetic spell accurately like live using Procs per minute.
Kayen: Adjusted Mob::TrySpellOnDeath() - Now checks all avialable effects and trys to use each one.
Kayen: Fixed SE_TargetsTarget - Target's Target must be in CombatRange to recieve the effect (Verified from live)
Kayen: Fixed TryApplyEffect - No longer incorrectly lands on the target's target's taget. (Example of spells that use this are Shaman Mending Couterbias)
Kayen: Adjusted Twincast to now select the buff with the highest chance to Twincast and use that, it will also stack with item focus and AA (when implemented).
Kayen: Removed the mana cost portion from twin casting a spell.
Kayen: Fix for SE_SympatheticProc - The focus effect now checks all items/buffs for the focus effect and adds all returned proc spellid's to a list from which one is randomly selected.
Kayen: Implemented SE_FF_Damage_Amount - Focus/Buff that adds damage to the casted spell. Usually found on spell group limited augments and stackable with SE_SpellDamage.
Kayen: Adjusted SE_SpellDamage to be handled properly as a focus effect.
Kayen: Extra damage from Focuses is now calculated correctly for DoTs
Kayen: Implemented Perl NPC Quest Object SetSpellFocusDMG(focus amount) - Focus all npc direct/dot damage spells by value

		- If a resist type SPECIFIC and a resist type ALL mod are applied to the same MOB, the SPECIFIC value will be used if spell cast on MOB is the same resist type.
Kayen: Implemented Perl Mob Quest Object GetModVulnerability(resist type) - Return the quest applied value for each resist (ALL = -1)

Secrets: Damage Shields now go to the proper filter, and do not show the non-melee damage to everyone.

==06/03/2012==
Akkadius: Added the ability to run a dual-stack global_player.pl with the existing player.pl that will run locally in quests/zone/player.pl or quests/templates/player.pl
	- This allows the player.pl to be ran globally without interference of a local script (quests/zone/player.pl OR quests/templates/player.pl)
	- 'global_player.pl' simply needs to be added to quests/templates/global_player.pl to be parsed otherwise it will not be loaded
	- 'global_player.pl' parses after the local player.pl
	- 'global_player.pl' parses all of the same events a regular player.pl does and will work with any new subroutines added to it in the future
	- Thanks Derision for being a pair of eyes on a part of the diff for this

==04/29/2012==
Derision: UF+: Support for the Extended Target window (aside from the Raid target types).
Derision: Fixed Extended Target bugs where CurrentTargetPC targets were incorrectly cleared when leaving a group, and a CurrentTargetPC wasn't updating when they zoned in.

cavedude: quest::buryplayercorpse will now despawn corpses in zones other than the client's current location, preventing dupes.
cavedude: Added quest::summonallplayercorpses (same syntax as quest::summonburriedplayercorpse) which will depop and summon all of the player's corpses, buried or not.
cavedude: Fixed a bug that caused some summoned corpses to use a static 5 minute decay timer.
cavedude: Changed player_corpses_backup schema to match player_corpses. If the rule is enabled, corpse backups will now be created for players that are high enough level to drop items to their corpses.
cavedude: Added a rule to determine whether or not to remove player corpse backups older than 2 weeks.
cavedude: #corpse now has options to depop a single player corpse, or every corpse belonging to a single player.
cavedude: You can now specify if a faction hit is temporary (is removed when player camps/zones) or whether or not to display the faction hit to the player in-game.
If temp in npc_faction_entries is set to:
0 (Default): Faction is permanent, player recieves a message. (Same functionality as we had previously.)
1: Faction is temporary, player does not recieve a message.
2: Faction is temporary, player recieves a message.
3: Faction is permanent, but player does not recieve a message.
cavedude: Added an optional argument to quest::faction to utilize the functionality and values listed above.
cavedude: Added minlevel and maxlevel to lootdrop_entries. The player credited with the kill (most hate) has their level checked against both columns, and if they are lower than the specified minlevel, or higer than the max, that item entry if it exists is removed from the NPC before it becomes a corpse.
cavedude: You can now specify if a NPC automatically repops (rerolls against their spawngroup) or depops after the reverse spawn timer is up.
If despawn in spawngroup is set to:
0 (Default): Do not depop or repop, no depop timer is set. (Same functionality as we had previously.)
1: Despawn the current NPC and repop the spawngroup after the associated spawn2 timer is up (including variance.)
2. Repop, after the value specified in despawn_timer is up (also uses spawn2 variance.)
3: Depop the NPC after the spawn2 timer is up + variance.
4. Depop the NPC after despawn_timer is up + variance.
Example: Setting despawn to 1 will despawn the NPC and immediately respawn the spawngroup after it has been up for the length of its spawn2 timer + variance.
Example: Setting despawn to 4 and despawn_timer to 3600 will depop the NPC after it has been up for an hour + variance. It then will respawn after its normal respawn timer is up.
cavedude: Fixed a crash in groups.cpp.

Trevius: Fixed inspect for SoF+ clients, which was broken by Rev2128.

==04/15/2012==
Derision: Added support for the 'Looking For Guild' window.

Required SQL: utils/sql/svn/2129_required_lfguild.sql

IMPORTANT NOTE:

To use this feature, you must be running the querserv process. If you are not running queryserv, LFGuild will not work, but your server will
run normally in all other respects.

Underfoot users can bring up the LFGuild Window by pressing the EQ buton and selecting Players/Looking For Guild.

I think all other clients can only access the feature by clicking on the notice boards in the Guild Lobby. To allow them to do this, you must
add the following to the SUB EVENT_CLICKDOOR of your guildlobby/player.pl

if(($doorid >= 5) && ($doorid <= 38))
{
	$client->OpenLFGuildWindow();
}

==04/14/2012==

==04/07/2012==
Trevius: Initial addition of the VoA (March 21 2012) client. To enable, you must uncomment the VoA lines in /common/patches.
Trevius: Many of the core systems are basically functional, but this client is still in an early development phase and not recommended for normal players yet.
Trevius: Non-Player Race spawns will cause the client to crash, so it is recommended to test it in an empty zone.
Trevius: Also, items in the bank will cause it to crash, but normal inventory seems to work fine so far.
Trevius: You cannot create a character on this client yet, so you must use an existing character.
Derision: VOA: Fixed zoning. Adjusted spawn encoding.

Secrets: Fixed a hanging issue introduced regardless of the item discovery feature was on or off. Keep in mind the item discovery feature still takes a reasonable amount of time to work, and this will be fixed in a future update.
Secrets: Added OP_IncreaseStats for use with the #incstats command (and other things, in due time!)
Secrets: Added QueryServ to the VS2008 project in preparation of moving eventlog, hackers, discovered items, and other non-essential database tasks over to it.

==02/03/2012==
Trevius: Added accout_status field to the discovered_items table to make it easier to remove accidental GM item discovery from the table.

Trevius: Added Grid ID to the #npstats command output.

==01/06/2012==
Trevius: Increased MAX_ITEM_ID to 200000 to match the new item ID max.  This is only used for Min Status on items.

Trevius: Fix for loading buffs on suspended pets.

==12/12/2011==
Trevius: Pets set to a petpower of -1 in the pets table will scale stats to the petpower like they used to.

==12/11/2011==
Bad_Captain: Fixed hatelist/aggro bug I introduced in rev 2087 causing NPCs to attack the closest client instead of the top of their hatelist.
Bad_Captain: Updated some live opcodes for EQExtractor.

==12/06/2011==
Leere: Added IsFromSpell to Attack() to allow its use from spell effects. This allows the Rampage AA to actually hit mobs again.
Leere: Added a rule for the minium hasted delay that can be reached for weapons. Default set to 400 based on best guesses from the Moss-Covered Twig tests posted on the net.
Congdar: (ptarp)compile warnings in windows
Bad_Captain: Fixed Enchanter's Mezmerization AA - it was extending buffs 35%, now extends mez spells by 1 tick / rank.

Trevius: Crash fix for trying to zone into a flagged zone without having the flag.

==12/04/2011==
Secrets: Added QueryServ for VS2010 x86/x64. QueryServ allows queries to be sent to it for use on an external database, through the means of packets.
Currently, the only thing it logs is a #command input, but that will be expanded onto soon. A suggestion for our developers would be to move any statistic logging stuff (hackers table, eventlog, etc) over to it eventually
to save processing power on the main executable's machine. This will allow for things like discovered items to work a bit more better resource-wise.
Akkadius: Added #advnpcspawn setversion (version#) - This will change the instance version in which the targeted NPC resides in
Akkadius: Added #npcedit setanimation (stand, sit, crouch, dead, loot (0-4)) so that setting animations are much easier. This also makes animations much more reliable setting them with the spawn packet rather than through Perl.
Akkadius: Added /MP switch to VS2008 so that it will compile with multiple processors
Akkadius: Fixed compiles for VS2008 from the Queryserv commit
Secrets: Added #qtest <string>, which will populate the remote database through QueryServ with information as a test only. Requires 255 status by default.
Trevius: LDoN points are now capped at 2,000,000,000 instead of ~16,000, and no longer roll back to 0 if they exceed the cap limit.

==12/01/2011==
Secrets: v90 toolset bugs reported on forums. In order to use Perl 5.14, you MUST upgrade to VS2010 (preferrably ultimate), if you do not have vs2010, it will default to Perl 5.10 and you will be unable to use the much more stable Perl 5.14, an upgrade is reccomended.
Secrets: Fixed Windows x64 rulesys bug where it would store them as an x64 version of an int (long long) and mess up the ordering of pointers, resulting in certain rules not loading properly.
NOTE: For those having issues compiling vs2010, there will be a guide up shortly to help you set up your dev environment. In the meantime, make sure your "Additional Include" and "Additional Library" paths
are correct and pointing at the right location. Failure to do so will result in mysql header/lib and perl header/lib issues. If you are looking for zlib x64, it's in SVN.

==11/30/2011==
Secrets: Implemented Visual Studio 11 and Visual Studio 10 project/sln files.
Secrets: Added x64 configuration settings to VS11 and VS10 project files/SLN files.
Secrets: Changed WIN32 define to _WINDOWS across the board. In the case where WIN32 is needed over WIN64 (ie; assembly references) there is still WIN32 defines and a new WIN64 define.
Secrets: Upgraded ActiveState Perl lib define to 5.14 -- others still work but it is strongly reccomended to use 5.14 as it contains less memory leaks.
Secrets: Added Zlib 1.2.3 x64 to the SVN for use with the windows solution files.
Secrets: Fixed vs2008 project files to reflect the new _WINDOWS define
Secrets: Perl 5.14 Compile Fix

NOTE: Since VS11 is in beta, I only set up the debug options. You should use Vs2010 Ultimate to compile in x64 mode.
NOTE2: Perl 5.14 is stable, but if you absolutely need to use 5.10, ctrl f search for "perl514.lib" and replace it with "perl510.lib"
NOTE3: A forum post will be made for help with compiling Windows x64 on EQEmulator.org, it is an experimental feature but has less issues than x64 linux, imo.

==11/28/2011==
Leere: Fixed a problem with no drop items inside of bags when trading with NPCs. Pets retain buff based procs through zoning now.

==11/26/2011==
Leere: NPCs now have the ability to ignore level limits for stuns. This ability can be turned off via rule. Also added a rule for what the base stun immunity level is for spells with a max level of 0.
Leere: NPCs (and thus pets) are now able to equip items in non-visble slots. They will also look inside of bags that are traded to them for those items.
The pets table was expanded. It can now map to several npc IDs for the same pet type string, based on pet power. (This has replaced the old approach of letting pet power be a direct boost to NPC stats. The intention is to now have distinct npc_type table entries for the various pet power levels that a pet supports.) Pet naming and pet control was likewise moved out of code logic and to the pets table. (The default pet control is now petFamiliar rather than petOther.) Pets can now have items already equipped when summoned. The equipment sets used for that can be shared between pets and also be nested up to a depth of 5.
Pets are no longer stored as part of the profile blobs.
Pets (charmed and summoned) belonging to clients should no longer attempt to assist other NPCs if they hear a call for help.

KLS: Fixed Item::IsAugmentable() to return correctly if the first augment slot is not used.
KLS: Updated for latest code and readded Derisions' cross-zone /inviting.  I've been testing it for a while now and can't find any real issues with it so I readded it.
KLS: Added class and race combo's into the database so they can be potentially changed; only SoF+ clients will correctly display this.
KLS: Fixed a bug in WorldDatabase::GetCharSelectInfo.
KLS: Changed internal faction values to go in order this change will break some quests in the short term but should be more intuitive in the long run.

KLS: CanClassX functions are no longer hardcoded, they will now check the skillcaps data instead.
KLS: EntityVariables are now identified with a string instead of an int ex: $npc->SetEntityVariable("SomeId", 5), this shouldn't break any existing quests.

Secrets: Opcode to remove all doors.
Secrets: Perl door support.
Secrets: Perl objects added for Doors since first PerlDoors commit: SetSize, GetSize, SetIncline, GetIncline, GetOpenType, SetOpenType
Secrets: Added quest::createdoor(model, x, y, z, h, [opentype], [size]) . This spawns a door similar to quest::creategroundobjectfrommodel, and can be manipulated in the same way as other doors. To save it, get the door object using $entity_list->GetDoorByID(id), as it returns an entity ID (and preliminary DBID/DoorID is stored on the object itself) upon creation of the door. otherwise the door is temporary, and does not save the stored DBID.  $doorobj->CreateDatabaseEntry() saves it and its temporary DBID + DoorID.
Secrets: Added door object perl functions GetLockpick() and SetLockpick([value]).

==06/10/2011==
JJ: Added more tables to remove entries from when deleting character.

==06/06/2011==
Secrets: Adjusted the default value for Character:SkillCapMaxLevel. It now defaults to 75 because PEQ only has skillcaps up to 75, and if the level is higher than 75 it will always return 0, breaking skills. (layer 8 issue fix)
Secrets: Made stat cap adjustable via rules, Character:StatCap. The client won't be in sync but that's what #mystats is for. 0 = feature disabled, defaults to 0.

Derision: Fixed /yell

==06/04/2011==
Secrets: Fixed pet HP resetting if the pet is above 32k when zoning.
Secrets: Fixed player HP rollover bug (~495k hitpoints, rarely encountered) with AAs by temporarily casting it as a float.
	 NOTE: the client only displays 10 million hitpoints in titanium. Keep that in mind when designing items. Only issue is displaying them, unlike the rollover bug you won't die and it will show on show/mystats.
Secrets: Fixed damage on weapons above 255. They only display on SoF+ clients, and Titanium will simply show a cosmetic issue (an incorrect value). You can set an item to any value up to the max for an uint32 and it will work.
Secrets: Added rules for the low-level damage cap. There is a rule for the pre-10 cap, and one for the pre-20 cap. Defaults to 20 and 40 respectively.

REQUIRED: You will have to recompile sharedmem with this update. Items will fail to load otherwise.

JJ: Implemented Arcane Tongues research AA. Chance for research success increases for each rank (10, 25, 50).
JJ: Implemented New Tanaan Crafting Mastery tradeskill AA. Each rank allows an additional tradeskill above 200.
Note: For servers with players who have tradeskills already above the limit without previously purchasing these AAs will freeze the chance to increase until they purchase the proper amount of NTCM AAs.

==05/24/2011==
KLS: Changed Mob::NPCSpecialAttacks(atk, perm) to Mob::NPCSpecialAttacks(atk, perm, [reset = 1], [remove = 0]).
This should allow one to add and remove flags individually without having to reset everything each time.
ex:
$npc->NPCSpecialAttacks(RQ, 0); //would enable the npc to rampage and quad.
$npc->NPCSpecialAttacks(S, 0, 0); //Would enable the NPC to summon as well as rampage and quad by telling it to set S but don't reset the earlier flags.

ex:
$npc->NPCSpecialAttacks(RQS, 0); //would enable the npc to rampage, quad and summon.
$npc->NPCSpecialAttacks(S, 0, 0, 1); //Would enable the NPC rampage and quad by telling it to set S but don't reset the earlier flags and also remove the flag being set.

==05/23/2011==
JJ: (Akkadius) Fixed camera shake usage output.

==05/22/2011==
KLS and Co:
-All liquid should count for skill ups.
-Finished unified quest interface... this is fairly large and will probably have a few problems here and there; report them to me and ill fix them asap.
The goal behind the system is to allow more than one scripting system to work at a time (though with limited interaction due to pre-existing implementation limitation).
This was a feature requested by the Dalaya community as they plan to merge back to the eqemu codebase and clients but are stuck with an old parser and thousands of files
that can't be realistically rewritten in a short time frame.

==05/20/2011==
JJ: Doubled buffer for tradeskill search when using experiment mode. Outputs message in error log when matches exceed buffer.

==05/17/2011==
JJ: Changed tradeskills to distinguish world containers in multiple recipe matches. Split invalid container vs. non-unique recipe error log entries. Allowed server to select first match for duplicate recipe contents.

==05/09/2011==
KLS: (lerxst2112) *nix compile fix.
KLS: Added #picklock #sensetrap and #disarmtrap for LDoN traps since they still don't work quite right on the newer clients because we don't implement destructable objects yet.

Secrets: #camerashake shakes the camera in every zone with required args intensity and duration.

==04/24/2011==
Trevius: Added new Perl Mob quest objects GetItemHPBonuses() and GetSpellHPBonuses().

==04/17/2011==
Secrets: Converted PVP flags to be a variable, as there are other PVP rulesets embedded in the client. These will need code support to work properly. (IsAttackAllowed specifically.)
Secrets: Enabled Firiona Vie ruleset as an option. This disables OOC, makes languages hard to understand between races (somehow), and disables no-drop. If set to 2, this rule will only affect GMs, allowing players to be traded no-drop items from GMs. Player-to-Player trades are still considered active hacks, and are still detected.
Secrets: Made a rule to toggle the GM Petition Window in titanium. You will need the guide petition files for that client, and it still needs code support to work. (find these yourself.)
Secrets: Added expansion settings to the rule_values table instead of the variables. The PVP settings will also be here now, too. (See Optional SQL with this update.)
Secrets: Fixed an issue pointed out by Trevius in the previous commit.

==02/13/2011==

Note: For opentype 57, the client automatically sends the click when the player moves onto the portal.

Optional SQL, to set the bazaar portal discs to type 57 (they are type 58 in the PEQ database, but collects show they should be type 57):

update doors set opentype = 57 where zone = 'bazaar' and name = 'PORTAL_DISC';

AndMetal: Changed AA Effects to be loaded into a map instead of a static array.
AndMetal: Changed weight in the client class to uint32 from int16 since the client uses 32 bits for the weight. This should prevent it from overflowing.

          AAs that have been converted: (Advanced) Innate STR / STA / AGI / DEX / INT / WIS / CHA, Innate Enlightenment, Natural Durability, Physical Enhancement, Planar Durability, Packrat. They should already be in the PEQ aa_effects table.
          For new AAs, you'll want to modify the StatBonuses struct in zone/mob.h. You'll also need to add a case in ApplyAABonuses in zone/bonuses.cpp to add it to aabonuses.
AndMetal: (via Congdar) Fix for quest::traindiscs().
AndMetal: Fixed Packrat. However, it doesn't seem to be updating correctly to the client (or we're taking too much off).
AndMetal: Added weight to #showstats, accurate to 1 decimal point.
KLS: NPCs will no longer try to base their attack speed off weapons they're using, the code wasn't working anyway.

AndMetal: Fixed a compile error introduced in Rev 729.
gaeorn: SE_Harmony and SE_ChangeFrenzyRad effects were reversed. This is based on info from alla regarding spells post OoW that only have SE_Harmony effect (reaction radius).
KLS: Added NPC code 'd' to make npcs be able to see through feign death attempts. (mostly implemented, still have to look into aggroing people who are feigned by proximity)
KLS: Fixed a typo in the petition code and un-reverted the petition.h file (hi, there's a reason it was changed).

Required SQL: \utils\sql\svn\665_heroic_resists.sql
Required SQL: utils/sql/svn/667_titles.sql

Recommended SQL: (This is recommended for databases that don't stay current with PEQ or are custom)
UPDATE items SET backstabdmg = damage WHERE backstabdmg = 0 AND itemtype = 2;

Warning: If you do not have a spells_new table yet, you must create one and load spells into it or zones will crash when loading in.
	 To create the spells_new table, use the SQL from \utils\sql\svn\230_spells_table.sql
	 After creating the table, you can import or export your spells from the spells_us.txt file by using the scripts:
	 import_spells.pl
	 export_spells.pl

	 The easiest way to import your spell file to the table is to move the import_spells.pl file to your main server directory
	 where your spells_us.txt file and your eqemu_config.xml file are.  Then run the following command at a command prompt:
	 perl import_spells.pl

See this post for more information on importing/exporting the spell file:

KLS: Hopefully fix for pets not giving adventure credit to players in ldon instances.

==06/07/2009==
NOTE (WildcardX): This version of the server code is a little dangerous for BOT enabled servers. I do not recommend using this revision for BOT enabled servers. Most of the existing BOT code is going to be re-implemented as a "BOT" object in the server code so until I complete this architecture change the BOT code may become somewhat unstable. I apologize for the inconvience but this is necessary to allow the server code for the BOTs to be more flexible and extensible than it is now.

Bug reports

Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/EQEmu/Server/issues) provided by GitHub to send us bug
reports or feature requests.

The [EQEmu Forums](http://www.eqemulator.org/forums/) also have forums to submit
bugs/get help with bugs.

Contributions

The preferred way to contribute is to fork the repo and submit a pull request on
GitHub. If you need help with your changes, you can always post on the forums or
try IRC. You can also post unified diffs (`git diff` should do the trick) on the
[Server Code Submissions](http://www.eqemulator.org/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=669)
forum, although pull requests will be much quicker and easier on all parties.
